way of interacting with your computer. You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them [in the glossary](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/command-line.md).) The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.\r\n\r\nThe command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.\r\n\r\n## What Does \"Text-based\" Mean?\r\n\r\nFor those of us comfortable reading and writing, the idea of \"text-based\" in the context of computers can seem a bit strange. As we start to get comfortable typing commands to the computer, it's important to distinguish \"text\" from word processed, desktop publishing. In the latter case, we use software (think Microsoft Word or Google Docs) that displays what we want to produce without showing us the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. On the other hand, while less pretty to look at, plain text has the advantage of being manipulable in different contexts.\r\n\r\nLet's take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.\r\n\r\n# Text Editors\r\n\r\n## What is Text?\r\n\r\nBefore we explain which program we'll be using for editing text, we want to give a general sense of this \"text\" we keep mentioning. For those of us in the humanities, whether we follow literary theorists who read any object as a \"text\" or we dive into philology, paleography, codicology or any of the fields [David Greetham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)) lays out in _Textual Scholarship_, \"text\" has its specific meanings. As scholars working with computers, we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ. Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us learned to use a word processor like Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without hidden formatting.\r\n\r\n![Word Doc](/images/command-line/worddoc.png)\r\n\r\nUsers with visual disabilities, [click here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/raw/v2.0/files/WordProcessorExample.docx) to download the Word file.\r\n\r\nIf you ask the command line to read that file, this Word `.docx` file will look something like this\r\n\r\n![Word Doc as visualized by Command Line](/images/command-line/CatWordDoc.png)\r\n\r\nUsers with visual disabilities, [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/v2.0/files/PK.md) to download the text file.\r\n\r\nWord documents which look like \"just words!\" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. Plain text files can be opened in a number of different editors and can be read within the command line.\r\n\r\n## Plain Text\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be as flexible as possible. Plain text include characters of readable material but not graphical representation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/),\r\n\r\n\u003e Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.\r\n\r\nPlain text shows its cards—if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable. Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement, plain text can be styled externally.\r\n\r\nA counterpoint to plain text is rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format `.rtf` file extension) or \"enriched text\" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs). In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the program in which they are made.\r\n\r\nPlain text has two main properties in regard to rich text:\r\n\r\n\u003e Plain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable.\r\n\r\n## Choosing a Text Editor\r\n\r\nAn important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.md`. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as `.docx` or `.rtf`, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly.\r\n\r\nWhile it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor.\r\n\r\nChoosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and \"hackability\" vary from program to program.\r\n\r\n## Default Recommendation\r\n\r\nFor our workshops, we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Not only is Visual Studio Code free and open source, but it is also consistent across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.\r\n\r\nYou will have downloaded Visual Studio Code according to the [instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) on the installations page. We won't be using the editor a lot in this tutorial, so don't worry about getting to know the editor now. In other workshops we will discuss syntax highlighting and version control, which Visual Studio Code supports. For now we will get back to working in the command line itself.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\n1. What is the difference between a plain text document and a rich text document? (Select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Plain text contains no formatting, only line breaks and spacing.*\r\n- Plain text cannot be marked up.\r\n- Rich text is styled text, _i.e.,_ plain text completed by information such as font size, format, and colors.*\r\n- One can't determine whether there is a difference between the two without looking at their content.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. What is the Command Line? How is it different from your text editor?\r\n\r\n# Why is the Command Line Useful?\r\n\r\nInitially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar. Why step away from a point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we'd like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe command line allows you to...\r\n\r\n- Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.\r\n- Set up your programming environment.\r\n- Run programs you create.\r\n- Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.\r\n- Control other computers remotely.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.\r\n\r\nWhat if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That's alright! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about **showing information** that the computer has, or **modifying or making** things (files, programs, etc.) on the computer.\r\n\r\nIn the next section, we'll make this a little more clear by getting started with the command line.\r\n\r\n# Getting to the Command Line\r\n\r\n## macOS\r\n\r\nIf you're using macOS:\r\n\r\n1. Click the Spotlight Search button (the magnifying glass) in the top right of your desktop.\r\n\r\n2. Type `terminal` into the bar that appears.\r\n\r\n3. Select the first item that appears in the list.\r\n\r\n4. When the Terminal pops up, you will likely see either a window with black text over white background or colored text over a black background.\r\n\r\n![Terminal in macOS](/images/command-line/osx_term.png)\r\n\r\nPlease note: You can change the color of your Terminal or BashShell background and text by selecting `Shell` from the top menu bar, then selecting a theme from the menu under `New Window`.\r\n\r\nBonus points: if you really want to get the groove of just typing instead of pointing and clicking, you can hold the \u003ckbd\u003ecommand (⌘)\u003c/kbd\u003e key while and press \u003ckbd\u003espace\u003c/kbd\u003e to pull up Spotlight search, start typing `Terminal,` and then hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e to open a terminal window. This will pull up a terminal window without touching your mousepad. For super bonus points, try to navigate like this for the next fifteen minutes, or even the rest of this session—it is tricky and sometimes a bit tiring when you start, but you can really pick up speed when you practice!\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nWe won't be using Windows's own non-UNIX version of the command line. Instead, we will use Git Bash. If you haven't installed it yet, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md). The reason we use Git Bash as the command line on Windows is that it makes you able to run the same commands as you would on a computer running macOS or Linux. Git Bash includes core utilities available on Linux that are not available on Windows.\r\n\r\n1. Look for Git Bash in your programs menu and open.\r\n\r\n2. If you can't find the git folder, just type `git bash` in the search box and select `git bash` when it appears.\r\n\r\n3. Open the program.\r\n\r\n4. When the terminal pops up, you will likely see either a window with black text over white background or colored text over a black background.You know you're in the right place when you see the `$`.\r\n\r\n  _Note that the sign for you being in the right place might also be a `%` or a `#` depending on your operating system._\r\n\r\n![Terminal on Windows](/images/command-line/win_term.png)\r\n\r\nBonus points: if you really want to get the groove of just typing instead of pointing and clicking, you can press \u003ckbd\u003ewindows\u003c/kbd\u003e to open the Start menu, start typing `git bash` and then hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e to open a git bash window. This will pull up a command window without touching your mousepad.\r\n\r\n## Command Prompt `$`\r\n\r\n`$`, which we will refer to as the \"command prompt,\" is the place you type commands you wish the computer to execute. We will now learn some of the most common commands.\r\n\r\nWhen you see the `$`, you're in the right place. As noted above, however, the sign varies somewhat between systems, and sometimes the sign is a `%` or a `#`. We call the sign the _command prompt_; it lets us know the computer is ready to receive a command.\r\n\r\nIn the following lessons, we will refer to the command prompt using a `$`. Just make a note now of your sign, if it differs from the dollar sign. You will be able to follow along just fine as long as you understand that they all are different ways of knowing that you are \"at the _command prompt_.\"\r\n\r\n# Prefatory Pro Tips\r\n\r\nBefore we get started, I wanted to give you a couple of tips of things to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. Go slow at first and check your spelling! One of the biggest things you can do to make sure your code runs correctly and you can use the command line successfully is to make sure you check your spelling! _Keep this in mind!_ If at first something doesn't work, check your spelling! Unlike in human reading, where letters operate simultaneously as atomistic symbols and as complex contingencies (check [Johanna Drucker](https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotated) on the alphabet), in coding, each character has a discrete function including (especially!) spaces.\r\n\r\n2. Keep in mind that the command line and file systems on macOS and Unix are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG—so capitalizations also matter when typing commands and file and folder names.\r\n\r\n3. While copying and pasting from this handy tutorial may be tempting to avoid spelling errors and other things, we encourage you not to! Typing out each command will help you remember them and how they work.\r\n\r\nNow, we are ready to get started.\r\n\r\n# Navigation\r\n\r\n## Getting started: know thyself\r\n\r\nYou may also see your username to the left of the command prompt `$`. Let's try our first command. Type the following and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e on your keyboard:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ whoami\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `whoami` command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command, press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e on your keyboard, and receive output.\r\n\r\n## Orienting Yourself in the Command Line: Folders\r\n\r\nOK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.\r\n\r\nYour computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or `root` folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:\r\n\r\n![An example of how a hierarchical filesystem looks](/images/command-line/hierarchical-filesystem-example.png)\r\n\r\nThe root or highest-level folder on macOS is just called `/`. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called `C:`. (If you are curious why `C:` is the default name on Windows, you can read about it [here](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/04/c-drive-default-windows-based-computers-2).)\r\n\r\nNote that we are using the word \"directory\" interchangeably with \"folder\"—they both refer to the same thing.\r\n\r\nOK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get output like `/Users/your-username`. That means you're in the `your-username` directory in the `Users` folder inside the `/` or root directory. This directory is often called the \"home\" directory.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, your output would instead be `C:/Users/your-username`. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and `pwd` stands for \"print working directory.\" \"Print\" as a word can be somewhat misleading. The command `pwd` won't actually print anything except on your screen. This command is easier to grasp when we interpret \"print\" as \"display.\"\r\n\r\nNow we know \"where\" we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the `your-username` directory, a.k.a. the working directory? Try entering:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ls\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a number of folders, probably including `Documents`, `Desktop`, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory. `ls` will \"list\" the contents of the directory you are in.\r\n\r\nWonder what's in the `Desktop` folder? Let's try navigating to it with the following command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `cd` command lets us \"change directory.\" (Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized.) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.\r\n\r\nSo how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our `pwd` command again. We should get:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n/Users/your-username/Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow try `ls` again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—`pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around.\r\n\r\nOne more command you might find useful is `cd ..` which will move you one directory up in the filesystem. That's a `cd` with two periods after it:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nBefore moving on, take a minute to navigate through our computer's file system using the command line. Use the three commands you've just learned—`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`—eight (8) times each. Go poking around your `Photos` folder, or see what's so special about that root `/` directory. When you're done, come back to your \"home\" folder with\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd ~\r\n```\r\n\r\n(That's a tilde \u003ckbd\u003e~\u003c/kbd\u003e, on the top left of your keyboard.) \r\n\r\n### Compare with the GUI\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that this is the same old information you can get by pointing and clicking displayed to you in a different way.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and use pointing and clicking to navigate to your working directory—you can get there a few ways, but try starting from \"My Computer\" and clicking down from there. You'll notice that the folder names should match the ones that the command line spits out for you, since it's the same information! We're just using a different mode of navigation around your computer to see it.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. Type `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located.\r\n2. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to enter a subfolder.\r\n3. Type `ls` to see the content of that folder.\r\n4. Type `cd ..` to leave that folder.\r\n5. Type `pwd` to make sure you are back to the folder where you wish to be.\r\n6. Type `cd ~` to go back to your home folder.\r\n7. Type `pwd` to make sure you are in the folder where you wish to be.\r\n8. Type `cd /` to go back to your root folder.\r\n9. Type `ls` to see the content of folder you are currently in.\r\n10. Type `pwd` to make sure you are in the folder where you wish to be.\r\n11. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to enter a subfolder.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\n1. What command do you run if you are trying to identify where in the filesystem you are currently located/working?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- $ `ls`\r\n- $ `pwd`*\r\n- $ `cd`\r\n- $ `whoami`\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. When and why would you want to use the command line as opposed to your operating system's GUI?\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Filesystem](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/filesystem.md)\r\n- [GUI](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/gui.md)\r\n- [Root](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/root.md)\r\n\r\n# Creating Files and Folders\r\n\r\n## Creating a File\r\n\r\nSo far, we've only performed commands that give us information. Let's use a command that creates something on the computer.\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you're in your home directory:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n/Users/your-username\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's move to the `Desktop` folder, or \"change directory\" with `cd`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've made sure you're in the `Desktop` folder with `pwd`, let's try a new command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ touch foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `touch` command is used to create a file without any content. This command can be used when you don’t have any data yet to store in it.\r\n\r\nIf the command succeeds, you won't see any output. Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called `foo.txt` on the desktop. Pretty cool, right?\r\n\r\n## Handy Tip: Up Arrow\r\n\r\nLet's say you liked that `foo.txt` file so much you'd like another! In the terminal window, press the \u003ckbd\u003eup arrow\u003c/kbd\u003e on your keyboard. You'll notice this populates the line with the command that you just wrote. You can hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e to create another `foo.txt,` (note - [`touch`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)) command will not overwrite your document nor will it add another document to the same directory, but it will update info about that file.) or you could use your left/right arrows to move the insert cursor around on the screen so you can, for instance, change the file name to `foot.txt` to create a different file.\r\n\r\nAs we start to write more complicated and longer commands in our terminal, the \u003ckbd\u003eup arrow\u003c/kbd\u003e is a great shortcut so you don't have to spend lots of time typing.\r\n\r\n## Creating Folders\r\n\r\nOK, so we're going to be doing a lot of work during the Digital Humanities Research Institute. Let's create a `projects` folder on our desktop, where we can keep all our work in one place.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's check to make sure we're still in the `Desktop` folder with `pwd`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n/Users/your-username/Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've double-checked you're in `Desktop`, we'll use the `mkdir` or \"make directory\" command to make a folder called `projects`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mkdir projects\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow run `ls` to see if a projects folder has appeared. Once you confirm that the projects folder was created successfully, `cd` into it.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd projects\r\n$ pwd\r\n/Users/your-username/Desktop/projects\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, now you've got a projects folder that you can use throughout the Institute. It should be visible on your graphical desktop, just like the `foo.txt` file we created earlier.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nTry and create a sub-folder and file on your own!\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. Type `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located. If you are not in the `projects` folder we just created, navigate to that folder using the commands you learned in the [lesson on navigation](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=6).\r\n2. Type `mkdir name-of-your-subfolder` to create a subfolder.\r\n3. Type `cd name-of-your-folder` to navigate to that folder.\r\n4. Type `challenge.txt` to create a new text file.\r\n5. Type `ls` to check whether you created the file correctly.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat does the \u003ckbd\u003eup arrow\u003c/kbd\u003e command do?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- It quits the Terminal/GitBash.\r\n- It undoes my last command.\r\n- It inserts my last command.*\r\n- It shows me what folder I am working in.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Creating a Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\nIn this section, we'll create a text file that we can use as a cheat sheet. You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning.\r\n\r\n## `Echo`\r\n\r\nInstead of creating an empty file like we did with `touch`, let's try creating a file with some text in it. But first, let's learn a new command: `echo`.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ echo \"Hello from the command line\"\r\nHello from the command line\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Redirect (`\u003e`)\r\n\r\nBy default, the echo command just prints out the text we give it. Let's use it to create a file with some text in it:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ echo \"This is my cheat sheet\" \u003e cheat-sheet.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's check the contents of the directory:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n/Users/your-username/projects\r\n$ ls\r\ncheat-sheet.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, so the file has been created. But what was the `\u003e` in the command we used? On the command line, a `\u003e` is known as a \"redirect.\" It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file. Be careful, since it's possible to overwrite files with the `\u003e` command.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add text to a file but _not_ overwrite it, you can use the `\u003e\u003e` command, known as the redirect and append command, instead. If there's already a file with text in it, this command can add text to the file _without_ destroying and recreating it.\r\n\r\n## `Cat`\r\n\r\nLet's check if there's any text in `cheat-sheet.txt`.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt\r\nThis is my cheat sheet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `cat` command prints the contents of a file to the screen. `cat` stands for \"concatenate,\" because it can link strings of characters or files together from end to end.\r\n\r\n## A Note on File Naming\r\n\r\nYour cheat sheet is titled `cheat-sheet.txt` instead of `cheat sheet.txt` for a reason. Can you guess why?\r\n\r\nTry to make a file titled `cheat sheet.txt` and observe what happens.\r\n\r\nNow imagine you're attempting to open a very important data file using the command line that is titled `cheat sheet.txt`\r\n\r\nFor your digital best practices, we recommend making sure that file names contain no spaces—you can use creative capitalization, dashes, or underscores instead. Just keep in mind that the macOS and Unix file systems are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInG, which means that capitalization matters when you type commands to navigate between or do things to directories and files. You may also want to avoid using periods in your file names, as they sometimes can prompt you to confuse them with system files or file extensions (e.g., the full name of a PDF file is usually `file.pdf`).\r\n\r\n## Using a Text Editor\r\n\r\nThe challenge for this section will be using a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code ([install guide here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md)), to add some of the commands that we've learned to the newly created cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as `.txt`, `.py` (Python scripts), and `.csv` (comma-separated values, also known as spreadsheet files). Remember not to use programs such as Microsoft Word to edit text files, since they add invisible characters that can cause problems.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nYou _could_ use the GUI to open your Visual Studio Code text editor—from your programs menu, via Finder or Applications or Launchpad in macOS, or via the Windows button in Windows—and then click `File` and then `Open` from the drop-down menu and navigate to your Desktop folder and click to open the `cheat-sheet.txt` file.\r\n\r\n_Or_, you can open that specific `cheat-sheet.txt` file in the Visual Studio Code text editor directly from the command line! Let's try that by using the `code` command followed by the name of your file in the command line. (Please note the command `code` prompts your computer to open Visual Code only if you have correctly completed [the software configuration](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) during installation.)\r\n\r\nOnce you've got your cheat sheet open in the Visual Studio Code text editor, type to add the commands we've learned so far to the file. Include descriptions about what each command does. Remember, this cheat sheet is for you. Write descriptions that make sense to you or take notes about questions.\r\n\r\nSave the file.\r\n\r\nOnce you're done, check the contents of the file on the command line with the `cat` command followed by the name of your file.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Step 1\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ code cheat-sheet.txt\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Step 2\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ cat cheat-sheet.txt\r\n    My Institute Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\n    ls\r\n    lists files and folders in a directory\r\n\r\n    cd ~\r\n    change directory to home folder\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat does effect does the following command produce? (select one)\r\n```console\r\n$ echo \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\" \u003e introduction.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- It adds the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\" to the existing content of the `introduction.txt` file.\r\n- It checks whether the content of the `introduction.txt` file contains the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\"\r\n- It replaces the content of the `introduction.txt` file with the line \"Hello! My Name is Mark!\"*\r\n- None of the above.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Pipes\r\n\r\nSo far, you've learned a number of commands and one special symbol, the `\u003e` or redirect. Now we're going to learn another, the `|` or \"pipe.\"\r\n\r\nPipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.\r\n\r\n![Pipes diagram](/images/command-line/pipes.png)\r\n\r\nLet's start with a simple example:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ echo \"Hello from the command line\" | wc -w\r\n5\r\n```\r\n![Pipes diagram](/images/command-line/example_pipes.png)\r\n\r\nIn this example, we take the output of the `echo` command (\"Hello from the command line\") and pipe it to the `wc` or word count command, adding a flag `-w` for number of words. The result is the number of words in the text that we entered. Flags marked with hyphens, such as `-l` or `-m`, indicate options which belong to specific commands.\r\n\r\nLet's try another. What if we wanted to put the commands in our cheat sheet in alphabetical order?\r\n\r\nUse `pwd` and `cd` to make sure you're in the folder with your cheat sheet. Then try:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see the contents of the cheat sheet file with each line rearranged in alphabetical order. If you wanted to save this output, you could use a `\u003e` to print the output to a file, like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort \u003e new-cheat-sheet.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat do pipes allow you to do? (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Pipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another.*\r\n- Pipes allow you to combine multiple commands in a single line.*\r\n- Pipes let you work on multiple files at the same time.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Exploring Text Data\r\n\r\nSo far the only text file we've been working with is our cheat sheet. Now, this is where the command line can be a very powerful tool: let's try working with a large text file, one that would be too large to work with by hand.\r\n\r\nLet's download the data we're going to work with:\r\n\r\n[Download `nypl_items.csv`](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/raw/v2.0/files/nypl_items.csv)\r\n\r\nIf you are using Chrome or Firefox, right click on the link above and select \"Save Link As...\"; make sure you name the file `nypl_items.csv`\r\nPlease note that, occasionally, [Chrome \"forgets\" to add the extension to your downloaded file](/images/command-line/savelinkaschrome.png); therefore, if your filename doesn't end with `.csv`, [feel free to add it manually](/images/command-line/savelinkaschrome2.png).\r\n\r\nOur data set is a list of public domain items from the New York Public Library. It's in `.csv` format, which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\" and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.\r\n\r\n## Move Command\r\n\r\nOnce the file is downloaded, move it from your `Downloads` folder to the `projects` folder on your desktop—either through the command line, or drag and drop in the GUI. Since this is indeed a command line workshop, you should try the former!\r\n\r\nTo move this file using the command line, you first need to navigate to your `Downloads` folder where that file is saved. Then type the `mv` command followed by the name of the file you want to move and then the file path to your `projects` folder on your desktop, which is where you want to move that file to (note that `~` refers to your home folder):\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mv nypl_items.csv ~/Desktop/projects/\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then navigate to that `projects` folder and use the `ls` command to check that the file is now there.\r\n\r\n## Viewing Data in the Command Line\r\n\r\nTry using `cat` to look at the data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can click \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ec\u003c/kbd\u003e on your keyboard to cancel the output if it's taking too long.)\r\n\r\nInstead, let's use another tool, the `less` command, to get the data one page at a time:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ less nypl_items.csv\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`less` gives you a paginated view of the data; it will show you contents of a file or the output from a command or string of commands, page by page.\r\n\r\nTo view the file contents page by page, you may use the following keyboard shortcuts (that should work on Windows using Git Bash or on macOS terminal):\r\n\r\nClick the \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e key to view forward one page, or the \u003ckbd\u003eb\u003c/kbd\u003e key to view back one page.\r\n\r\nOnce you're done, click the \u003ckbd\u003eq\u003c/kbd\u003e key to return to the command line.\r\n\r\nLet's try two more commands for viewing the contents of a file:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ head nypl_items.csv\r\n...\r\n\r\n$ tail nypl_items.csv\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese commands print out the very first (the \"head\") and very last (the \"tail\") sections of the file, respectively.\r\n\r\n## Cleaning the Data\r\n\r\nWe didn't tell you this before, but there are duplicate lines in our data! Two, to be exact. Before we try removing them, let's see how many entries are in our `.csv` file:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | wc -l\r\n100001\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells us there are 100,001 lines in our file. The `wc` tool stands for \"word count,\" but it can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell `wc` to count lines by using the `-l` flag. If we wanted to count characters, we could use `wc -m`.\r\n\r\nTo find and remove duplicate lines, we can use the `uniq` command. Let's try it out:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | uniq | wc -l\r\n99999\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, the count went down by two because the `uniq` command removed the duplicate lines. But which lines were duplicated?\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | uniq -d\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `uniq` command with the `-d` flag prints out the lines that have duplicates.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nUse the commands you've learned so far to create a new version of the `nypl_items.csv` file with the duplicated lines removed. (Hint: _redirects_ from the lesson when we made a [cheat sheet](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=8) are your friend.)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nType `pwd` to see where on your computer you are located. If you are not in the `projects` folder we just created, navigate to that folder using the commands you learned in the [lesson on navigation](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=6).\r\n\r\nType `ls` to check whether the file `nypl_items.csv` is in your projects folder.\r\n\r\nType `cat nypl_items.csv | uniq \u003e new_nypl_items.csv` to create a new version of the `nypl_items.csv` file with the duplicated lines removed.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat do command line flags allow you to do? (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Flags allow you to earmark the file you are working on.\r\n- Flags are useful to create a new version of the file you are working on, while preserving the old version for future access.\r\n- Flags are a common way to specify options for command line programs.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Path](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/path.md)\r\n\r\n# Interlude\r\n\r\n## A Favorite Command Line Feature: Tab Completion\r\n\r\nWhen you are navigating in the command line, typing folder and file names can seem to go against the promise of easier communication with your computer. Here comes _tab completion_, stage right!\r\n\r\nWhen you need to type out a file or folder name—for example, the name of that csv file we've been working with: `nypl_items.csv`—in the command line and want to move more quickly, you can just type out the beginning characters of that file name up until it's distinct in that folder and then click the \u003ckbd\u003etab\u003c/kbd\u003e key. And voilà! Clicking that \u003ckbd\u003etab\u003c/kbd\u003e key will complete the rest of that name for you, and it only works if that file or folder already exists within your working directory.\r\n\r\nIn other words, anytime in the command line you can type as much of the file or folder name that is unique within that directory, and \u003ckbd\u003etab\u003c/kbd\u003e complete the rest!\r\n\r\n## Clearing Text\r\n\r\nIf all the text remaining in your terminal window is starting to overwhelm you, you have some options. You may type the `clear` command into the command line, or click the \u003ckbd\u003ecommand (⌘)\u003c/kbd\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003ek\u003c/kbd\u003e keys to clear the scrollback. Pressing the \u003ckbd\u003ecommand (⌘)\u003c/kbd\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003el\u003c/kbd\u003e keys in macOS, or \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e and \u003ckbd\u003el\u003c/kbd\u003e in Windows will clear the output from your most recent command.\r\n\r\n# Searching Text Data\r\n\r\nSo we've cleaned our data set, but how do we find entries that use a particular term?\r\n\r\nLet's say I want to find all the entries in our data set that use the term \"Paris.\"\r\n\r\nHere we can use the `grep` command. `grep` stands for \"global regular expression print.\" The `grep` command processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. Regular expressions are special strings representing a pattern to be matched in a search operation. `grep` gives us access to the power of regular expressions as we search for text.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | grep -i \"paris\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will print out all the lines that contain the word \"Paris.\" (The `-i` flag makes the command ignore capitalization.) Let's use our `wc -l` command to see how many lines that is:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat nypl_items.csv | grep -i \"paris\" | wc -l\r\n191\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have asked `cat` to read `nypl_items.csv`, take the output and pipe it into the `grep -i` command, which will ignore capitalization and find all instances of the word `paris`. We then take the output of that `grep` command and pipe it into the word count `wc` command with the `-l` lines option. The pipeline returns `191` letting us know that \"Paris\" (or \"paris\") occurs on 191 lines of our data set.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nUse the `grep` command to explore our `.csv` file a bit. What areas are best covered by the data set?\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nIf you want to get a little more milage out of the `grep` command, refer to [this tutorial on grep and regular expressions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-grep-regular-expressions-to-search-for-text-patterns-in-linux). Regular expressions (or regex) provide methods to search for text in more advanced ways, including specific wildcards, matching ranges of characters such as letters and numbers, and detecting features such as the beginning and end of lines. If you want to experiment with regular expressions in an easy-to-use environment, numerous regex test interfaces are available from [a simple google search](https://www.google.com/search?w\u0026q=regex+tester), such as [RegExr](https://regexr.com/), which includes a handy cheat sheet.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nLet's think about the `grep` command. Select all that pertain to the command.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words.*\r\n- It can be combined with other commands, so as to produce a search that matches their output.*\r\n- It produces a new file with the lines containing the strings or words you are searching.\r\n- It delete the strings or words you are searching from a file.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# What We Have Learned\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to do a quick review!\r\n\r\nIn this session, we learned:\r\n\r\n- how to use `touch` and `echo` to create files\r\n- how to use `mkdir` to create folders\r\n- how to navigate our file structure by `cd`(change directory), `pwd` (print working directory), and `ls` (list)\r\n- how to use redirects (`\u003e`) and pipes (`|`) to create a pipeline\r\n- how to explore a comma separated values (`.csv`) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`\r\n- how to search text files using the `grep` command\r\n\r\nAnd we made a [cheat sheet](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/command-line/lessons/?page=8) for reference!\r\n\r\nWhen we started, we reviewed what text is—whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output.\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\nYou've made it through your introduction to the command line! By now, you have experienced some of the power of communicating with your computer using text commands. The basic steps you learned today will help as you'll further your digital skills. For example, you might work with the command line interface to set up your [version control with git](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git) or you'll have your text editor open while [writing python scripts](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python) or building basic websites with [HTML and CSS](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css). Having a grasp of command line basics will not only make you more familiar with how your computer and basic programming work, but it will also give you access to tools and communities that will expand your research.\r\n\r\n## Review your knowledge: 7 questions from the lessons\r\n\r\n__1.

Human computers received commands from analysts—predominantly men with the military—that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun (p. 34) argued, 'computation depends on 'yes, sir' in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands ...

We will also be discussing the ethical issues that arise in data collection, cleaning, and representation. Because everyone has a different approach and understanding to data and ethics, this workshop will also include multiple sites for discussions to help us think through what data literacies mean within our projects and broader applications.\r\n\r\n### What Constitutes Research Data?\r\n\r\nThese quotes below offers a variety of perspectives to understanding research data across different stakeholders. The inclusion of these different approaches to research data is to suggest that there is no singular, definitive approach, and is dependent on multiple factors, including your project considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003e Material or information on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e — [Queensland University of Technology.

What can you/do you count as data? Here's a small list of possibilities:\r\n\r\n- Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)\r\n- Digital texts or digital copies of text\r\n- Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS, R)\r\n- Scientific sample collections\r\n- Data visualizations\r\n- Computer code\r\n- Standard operating procedures and protocols\r\n- Protein or genetic sequences\r\n- Artistic products\r\n- Curriculum materials (e.g. course syllabi)\r\n- Spreadsheets (e.g. `.xlsx`, `.numbers`, `.csv`)\r\n- Audio (e.g. `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`)\r\n- Video (e.g. `.mov`, `.mp4`)\r\n- Computer Aided Design/CAD (`.cad`)\r\n- Databases (e.g. `.sql`)\r\n- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data (e.g. `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`)\r\n- Digital copies of images (e.g. `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`)\r\n- Web files (e.g. `.html`, `.asp`, `.php`)\r\n- Matlab files \u0026 3D Models (e.g. `.stl`, `.dae`, `.3ds`)\r\n- Metadata \u0026 Paradata (e.g. `.xml`, `.json`)\r\n- Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research\r\n\r\n\r\nAdapted from: [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/)\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nResearch data can be defined as: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- materials or information necessary to come to my conclusion.*\r\n- the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.*\r\n- method of collection and analysis.\r\n- objective and error-free.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Forms of Data\r\n\r\nThese are some (most!) of the shapes your research data might transform into.\r\n\r\n1. What are some forms of data you use in your work?\r\n2. What about forms of data that you produce as your output? Perhaps there are some forms that are typical of your field.\r\n3. Where do you usually get your data from?\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. As I am currently exploring discourses on various social media ecosystem, I tend to extract/scrape data that comes through as JSON files, which is a text-file type that is often used to structure large data sets. Sometimes they also come in other forms of data bases such as CSVs or XLS.\r\n2. Often times outputs are statistical analysis and various data visualizations. This is also pretty comment in my field of psychology.\r\n3. I can get them from large databases like pushshift.io or scrape certain social media outlets directly such as Twitter.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n# Stages of Data\r\n\r\nWe begin without data. Then it is observed, or made, or imagined, or generated. After that, it goes through further transformations. Stages of data typically consist of a) collection of \"raw\" data, b) processing and/or transforming data, c) cleaning, d) analysis, and e) visualization. For example, we can consider the stages in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. We start with formulating a research question(s) or hypotheses and set up a project to answer our question(s).\r\n    - E.g. What proportion of the artwork collected and/or hosted in the Met are by non cis-gender men artists and also in public domain?\r\n2. In the process of setting up the project, we make decisions on what kind of data we think can help us to answer the question.\r\n    - E.g. I think I can get the data from the Met's [open access data set](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/metmuseum/openaccess/master/MetObjects.csv). I will need to look at what variables exist in the dataset to find out if I can filter by gender and the variables that will correspond to copyrights.\r\n3. After collecting our data we then consider and make decisions in the processes of cleaning.\r\n    - E.g. I have to transform some of the gender values and decide what to do with the missing fields.\r\n4. We then run our preliminary analysis of the data.\r\n    - E.g. I can run an analysis of the subset of non cis-gender men and public domain media objects against the total number of media objects to find out the proportion.\r\n5. At the end of our analysis, a decision is then made about how would we would present the data and its analysis.\r\n    - E.g. I can present the result in a pie chart.\r\n\r\nThis is one cycle in which data goes from collection to transformation to visualization. This is also *not* the only way to go through the stages. For example, we could do a preliminary analysis first, such as running a correlation of variables, to explore what is missing before we begin the process of cleaning. Often, we also end up doing multiple iterations of cleaning and analysis, making decisions and choices to collapse particular variables or remove them entirely at each iterations. Making sure that we keep a clear documentation of our process will ensure that we are accountable to the data we have collected/are using and also ensure that our results can be replicated and reproduced if others choose to work on our \"raw\" data.\r\n\r\n## Naming Conventions for Directory Structures\r\n\r\nBefore beginning your data collection, manipulation, and transformation, a good practice is to determine your file naming conventions. How many times have named something as `XXX_FinalFINALFINAL.pdf` or have difficulty searching for a version of the file that contained all that good idea that was edited out in the `XXX_FinalFINALFINALFINAL.pdf` version? While tools like version controlling with git can be helpful, we can also begin with setting up file naming conventions that can help us succeed! Here's an example from [Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/case-studies/case-study-file-naming) that demonstrates the problems of badly name files in our projects.\r\n\r\nFor example, The Graduate Center's [Data Management](https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/c.php?g=159618\u0026p=1045090) guide suggest that top level folders (such as your main project folder) should include your project title, a unique identifier and the date (year) of your project (e.g. `dataliteracies_XYZ_2020`). Your sub folders and individual files should follow a similar system, with an identifiable activity or project in the file name (e.g. a sub-folder of the project: `sections_xyz_2020`, a file in the project: `lessons_XYZ_2020.doc`).\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/data.md)\r\n\r\n# Stages of Data: Raw\r\n\r\n\"Raw\" data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated by a human or computer. Received or collected data could be in any number of formats, locations, etc.. It could be in any of the forms listed in the previous section.\r\n\r\nBut \"raw\" data is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product and work on it further, and for them that data is \"raw\" data. For example, I may consider the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/) data to be \"raw\" as it will require me to filter out missing entries and collapse variables or fields before I can run my analysis. A researcher who participated in the creation of this survey may not consider the version on the site as \"raw\" because the \"raw\" version is the physical paper copies of the file. As you can see, this consideration of what is \"raw\" is non-definitive and is dependent on the project you are working on and the narrative you want to tell with the results.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in further exploration and discussion of the ethics of \"raw\" data, please consider reading [Drucker's article](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html) which has made useful distinctions between \"data\" (understood as given) and \"capta\" (taken or \"captured\") that also troubles the distinction between \"raw\" and \"processed\" data. \r\n\r\n## Data and Labor\r\n\r\nAs we think about data collection, we should also consider the labor involved in the process. Many researchers rely on Amazon Mechanical Turk (sometimes also referred to as MTurk) for data collection, [often paying less than minimum wage for the task.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/) Often the assumption made of these workers is someone who is retired, bored, and participating in online gig work for fun or to kill time. While this may be true for some, [more than half of those surveyed in a Pew Research study cite that the income from this work is essential or important](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/11/17/labor-platforms-technology-enabled-gig-work/). Those who do view the income from this work as essential or important are also mostly from underserved communities. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being mindful of paying a fair wage to the workers on such platforms, this kind of working environment also brings some further considerations to the data that is collected. For instance, to get close to minimum wage, workers cannot afford to spend much time on each task. Thinking through these circumstances, how do you think it impacts the data we collected? \r\n\r\nFor a deeper discussion on data and labor, consider Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's chapter [Show Your Work](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0vgzaln4/release/2?readingCollection=0cd867ef) in *[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)*.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\n1. The stages of data is a single iteration process, i.e. there is a fixed stage progression from data collection to visualization.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True\r\n- False*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. Which of the following statements are true for \"raw\" data: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- is data that is yet to be processed.*\r\n- is data that is received and/or collected.*\r\n- is the same to every researcher/research team.\r\n- can only be collected from participants.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Raw Data and Labor\r\n\r\n1. Do you think \"big data\" is \"raw data\"? Why or why not? Do quantity of data play into our assumptions of \"rawness\"?\r\n2. How should we approach data that we have \"scraped\"?\r\n3. How do you collect \"raw\" data? What are some of your practices? What are your field's practices?\r\n4. If you have not done so, open up `moSmall.csv` from your local computer/laptop. As the original file has about 500,000 entries, we've taken a random sample of 1% of the [original dataset](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess). In this case, would you consider this file to be a \"raw\" dataset?\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. I think big data can be raw data depending on how the data is obtained and the processes I need to take before I can apply an analysis. I think that with large datasets, I always assume \"rawness\" because I won't need all of the variables or there will be decisions that need to be made about missing entries.\r\n2. I think my approach to scraped data is similar to big data.\r\n3. Currently I collect through either pushshift.io or scrap permissible social media sites on my own or with my collaborator (who will have appropriate authorship). I know that my field of psychology is guilty of the discussion on mechanical turk and also often rely on undergraduates for experimental data collection who would have to sign up for experiments for credits in class or do the labour of working in the lab for the promises of bettering their resume for grad school applications.\r\n4. The dataset is \"raw\" to me as I will likely be working on removing certain variables/entries to work towards my question.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/data.md)\r\n- [\"Raw\" Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/raw-data.md)\r\n\r\n# Stages of Data: Processed/Transformed\r\n\r\nProcessing data puts it into a state more readily available for analysis and makes the data legible. For instance, it could be rendered as **structured data**. This can also take many forms, e.g., a table. The following sections describe a few common formats for structured data.\r\n\r\n## XML\r\n\r\n**XML** or eXstensible Markup Language, uses a nested structure, where the \"tags\" like `\u003cCat\u003e` contain other tags inside them, like `\u003cfirstName\u003e`. This format is good for organizing the layout of a document in a tree-like format, just like HTML, where we want to nest elements like a sentence within a paragraph, for example. XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed and can be used in a variety of presentation scenarios.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003cCats\u003e\r\n    \u003cCat\u003e\r\n        \u003cfirstName\u003eSmally\u003c/firstName\u003e\r\n        \u003clastName\u003eMcTiny\u003c/lastName\u003e\r\n    \u003c/Cat\u003e\r\n    \u003cCat\u003e\r\n        \u003cfirstName\u003eKitty\u003c/firstName\u003e\r\n        \u003clastName\u003eKitty\u003c/lastName\u003e\r\n    \u003c/Cat\u003e\r\n    \u003cCat\u003e\r\n        \u003cfirstName\u003eFoots\u003c/firstName\u003e\r\n        \u003clastName\u003eSmith\u003c/lastName\u003e\r\n    \u003c/Cat\u003e\r\n    \u003cCat\u003e\r\n        \u003cfirstName\u003eTiger\u003c/firstName\u003e\r\n        \u003clastName\u003eJaws\u003c/lastName\u003e\r\n    \u003c/Cat\u003e\r\n\u003c/Cats\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of XML cats file](/images/data-ethics/cats_XML.png)\r\n\r\nThis file is viewed on an online [XML Viewer](https://www.xmlviewer.org/). If you would like to, you can either copy the code chunk above to try it out on [XML Viewer](https://www.xmlviewer.org) or [download the XML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.xml) to try it out in other viewers.

(Psst! Try right clicking on `cats.xml` in your local directory and choosing `Open with Other Application` in the drop down menu to select the browser of your choice.)\r\n\r\n## JSON\r\n\r\n**JSON** or JavaScript Object Notation, also uses a nesting structure, but with the addition of *key/value* pairs, like the `\"firstName\"` *key* which is tied to the `Smally` *value* (at least for the first cat!). JSON is popular with web applications that save and send data from your browser to web servers, because it uses the main language of web browsers, JavaScript, to work with data.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"Cats\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"firstName\": \"Smally\",\r\n            \"lastName\": \"McTiny\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"firstName\": \"Kitty\",\r\n            \"lastName\": \"Kitty\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"firstName\": \"Foots\",\r\n            \"lastName\":\"Smith\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"firstName\": \"Tiger\",\r\n            \"lastName\":\"Jaws\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of JSON cats file](/images/data-ethics/cats_JSON.png)\r\n\r\nThis file is viewed on my Firefox browser from my local directory.

Each line (First Name, Last Name) is a new \"record\" and each column (separated by a comma) is a new \"field.\" This data format stores tabular data in a clean way that facilitates the transfer between different data architectures. As data types go, it is very rudimentary (even predating computers!) and is easy to type, without needing special characters beyond a comma.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFirst Name,Last Name\r\nSmally,McTiny\r\nKitty,Kitty\r\nFoots,Smith\r\nTiger,Jaws\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of CSV cats file](/images/data-ethics/cats_CSV.png)\r\n\r\nThis file is viewed on my VSCode with the extension `Excel Viewer`.

You can also [download the CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.csv) to open it in other viewers (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Notepad). To save the file onto your local computer, **right click** on `Raw` button (top right-hand corner of the data set) and click `Save Link As...` to save the file onto your local computer.\r\n\r\n## The Importance of Using Open Data Formats\r\n\r\nA small detour to discuss data formats. Open data formats are usually available to anyone free-of-charge and allows for easy reusability. Proprietary formats often hold copyrights, patents, or have other restrictions placed on them, and are dependent on (expensive) licensed softwares. If the licensed software cease to support its proprietary format or it becomes obsolete, you may be stuck with a file format that cannot be easily open or (re)used (e.g. .mac). For accessibility, future-proofing, and preservation, keep your data in open, sustainable formats. A demonstration:\r\n\r\n1. Open [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/v2.0/files/cats.csv) in a [text editor](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/choosing-a-text-editor.md) (e.g. Visual Studio Code, TextEdit (macOS), NotePad (Windows) ), and then in an app like Excel. This is a CSV, an open, text-only, file format.

How do you decide the formats to store your data when you transition from 'raw' to 'processed/transformed' data? What are some of your considerations?\r\n2. Explore the `moSmall.csv` dataset, what questions might you ask with this dataset? What columns (variables) will you keep?\r\n3. If you are saving the file `moSmall.csv` in a proprietary spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel (Windows/macOS) or Numbers (macOS), you may be prompted to save the file as `.xlsx` or `.numbers`. What format would you choose to save it in? Why would you choose to do so?\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. I usually go with the conventions of the field as it allows me to share my \"in progress\" work easily with my research lab and collaborators. The file conventions can range from `.csv` to `.json`.\r\n2. I will keep columns (variables) relevant to my question, such as the `Artist Gender`, `Is Public Domain` and `Rights and Reproduction` columns. I will also keep some of the descriptive columns such as `Object ID` and `Artist Role` to help contextualize the results (e.g. what kind of roles do female artists tend to take on?)\r\n3. I will choose to keep it in a `.csv` file type as it can be opened up by more programs and if Microsoft stops supporting `.xlsx` file types I may no longer have access to opening the dataset. **or** I will choose to switch to a `.xlsx` format as it is easier to use on a graphical user interface like Microsoft Excel. Any stylistic changes I've made to the file will remain as well, such as alternative highlighting rows for readability or bolding column headings.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [CSV (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/csv.md)\r\n- [XML (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/xml.md)\r\n- [JSON (file format)](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/json.md)\r\n- [Open Data Formats](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/open-data-formats.md)\r\n\r\n# Side Note on Data Structures: Tidy Data\r\n\r\nThere are different guidelines to the processing of data, one of which is the [Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) format, which follows these rules in structuring data:\r\n\r\n1. Each variable is in a column.\r\n2. Each observation is a row.\r\n3. Each value is a cell.\r\n\r\nLook back at our example of cats to see how they may or may not follow those guidelines. **Important note:** some data formats allow for more than one dimension of data (like the `JSON` structure below). How might that complicate the concept of **Tidy Data**?\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"Cats\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"Calico\": [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"firstName\": \"Smally\",\r\n                        \"lastName\":\"McTiny\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"firstName\": \"Kitty\",\r\n                        \"lastName\": \"Kitty\"\r\n                    }\r\n                ],\r\n                \"Tortoiseshell\": [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"firstName\": \"Foots\",\r\n                        \"lastName\":\"Smith\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"firstName\": \"Tiger\",\r\n                        \"lastName\":\"Jaws\"\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile tiny data is a really popular method of structuring and organizing data, it is not the only way to do so. Depending on the type of data you have, it is also not always the best way to structure data.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\n1. Tiny data format only allows one value per cell.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. Do you think you can explain the rules of tidy data structuring?\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Tidy Data\r\n1. Looking at the `moSmall.csv` dataset, there are a couple of columns with nested information that don't follow the rules of tidy data. Can you identify at least two of the columns that demonstrates this?\r\n2. Would you convert `moSmall.csv` to follow the tidy data format? Can you demonstrate how you would do so?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. `Artist Role`, `Artist Display Name`, `Artist Display Bio`, `Artist Alpha Sort`, `Artist Nationality`, `Artist Begin Date`, `Artist End Date`, or `Classification`.\r\n2. I will choose to convert to the tidy data format if I was interested in any of the variables listed above, so that it will be easier to analyse the entries. I will have to unnest the entries by separating the data into different columns. For example, if I am interested in understanding the type of roles that are predominantly held by non-cisgender men, I will unnest the column `Artist Role` as two columns (e.g. `Artist 1 Role`, `Artist 2 Role`) as illustrated in this example:\r\n\r\n![Comparison of moSmall after tidy format](/images/data-ethics/moSmall2_tidytogether.png)\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Tidy Data](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tidy-data.md)\r\n\r\n# More Stages of Data: Cleaned\r\n\r\nHigh quality data is measured in its **validity**, **accuracy**, **completeness**, **consistency**, and **uniformity**.\r\n\r\nProcessed data, even in a table, is going to be full of errors:\r\n\r\n1. Empty fields\r\n2. Multiple formats, such as \"yes\" or \"y\" or \"1\" for a positive response.\r\n3. Suspect answers, like a date of birth of 00/11/1234\r\n4. Impossible negative numbers, like an age of \"-37\"\r\n5. Dubious outliers\r\n6. Duplicated rows\r\n7. And many more!\r\n\r\nCleaning data is the work of correcting the errors listed above, and moving towards high quality. This work can be done manually or programmatically.\r\n\r\n### Validity\r\n\r\nMeasurements must be valid, in that they must conform to set constraints:\r\n\r\n1. The aforementioned \"yes\" or \"y\" or \"1\" should all be changed to one response.\r\n2. Certain fields cannot be empty, or the whole observation must be thrown out.\r\n3. Uniqueness, for instance no two people should have the same social security number.\r\n\r\n### Accuracy\r\n\r\nMeasurements must be accurate, in that they must represent the correct values. While an observation may be valid, it might at the same time be inaccurate. 123 Fake street is a valid, inaccurate street address.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, accuracy is mostly achieved in the observation process. To be achieved in the cleaning process, an outside trusted source would have to be cross-referenced.\r\n\r\n### Completeness\r\n\r\nMeasurements must be complete, in that they must represent everything that might be known. This also is nearly impossible to achieve in the cleaning process! For instance in a survey, it would be necessary to re-interview someone whose previous answer to a question was left blank.\r\n\r\n### Consistency\r\n\r\nMeasurements must be consistent, in that different observations must not contradict each other. For instance, one person cannot be represented as both dead and still alive in different observations.\r\n\r\n### Uniformity\r\n\r\nMeasurements must be uniform, in that the same unit of measure must be used in all relevant measurements. If one person's height is listed in meters and another in feet, one measurement must be converted.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nMeasurements are *accurate* when: (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- observations do not contradict each other.\r\n- they represent the correct values.*\r\n- when they are unique responses (e.g. no duplication).\r\n- when the same unit of measure is used in all relevant measurements.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenge: When Do We Stop Cleaning?\r\n\r\n1. How do we know when our data is cleaned enough?\r\n2. What happens to the data that is removed?\r\n3. Explore the `moSmall.csv` dataset.\r\n    - Are all the measurements valid? Try checking the `Object ID` column for duplicates.\r\n    - How might you check if the `Is Public Domain` accurately represents the copyrights of the media objects?\r\n    - Is the data collected completed? How might you deal with the NA or empty fields?\r\n        - What assumptions do you have to make when you clean NA or empty fields?\r\n    - Is the collected data consistent? Does the column `Is Public Domain` correspond with the data in `Rights and Reproduction`? If it does not, which would you follow? Why?\r\n    - As the dataset is not one that we personally collected, how do we make sense that only `Female` or `|` is collected as responses in the column (with the exception of NA and empty fields)? What do we have to do to the data to make sure it is uniform? What decisions do we make in this process?\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. I think this is often decided before the cleaning process begins, perhaps after some quick visualization or analysis of the \"raw\" data. I generally remove empty entries from my data sets. Working with social media data, I also usually remove URLs as these influence the topic modelling algorithms (e.g. \"http\" may end up being the most prominent topic of the corpus). This is usually where I stop cleaning. Some might suggest the removal of stop words like \"the\" \"a\" \"an,\" but I have always felt very uncertain about the removal of these words. This is especially because the dictionary of stop words were generated through canon western texts that is not representative of the many variations of English. For example, if I were looking at the tweets of Singaporean youths, the stop word dictionary may not be appropriate.\r\n2. For me, the data is often destroyed (usually because IRB desires it) or it remains in the original \"raw\" file. The file that I clean will always be a duplicate file to allow for recovery in case I made a poor decision in the process of cleaning.\r\n3. Exploring the dataset, here are my responses to the questions:\r\n    - Using `Object ID` indicates that there is no duplicates in the dataset. Every entry is unique.\r\n    - I will have to compare it to another trusted source like a database from [The Getty Research Institute](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/).\r\n    - The data collected is not completed. There are missing fields. Depending on where the missing field is, I may choose to code it as `0` for the ease of analysis. For example, the column `Dynasty` only contain 1 meaningful entry within this sample data set, as such, I will not run any analysis that may rely on this column and choose to drop it. The column `Accession Year` only has 1 NA and I will choose to drop that row if this becomes a useful variable for my analysis.\r\n    - While the `Rights and Reproduction` contains a lot of NA and inappropriate responses (e.g. \"Ceramics\"), for the most part, for the items labeled as `YES` in the column `Is Public Domain` the corresponding column in `Rights and Reproduction` does not record a copyright holder. I am assuming that the NA can stand in for the object being in the public domain.\r\n    - Taking only `Female` as a valid gender response, everything else will be converted to a `0` for ease of analysis. I am assuming `|` as equivalent to a NA or an empty field rather than an alternative gender. Hence in my analysis, the proportion will only record female artists' objects against the rest of the collected items. I cannot necessarily answer the larger question of all non-cisgender men against the total in this case.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n# More Stages of Data: Analyzed\r\n\r\nAnalysis can take many forms (just like the rest of this stuff!), but many techniques fall within a couple of categories:\r\n\r\n### Descriptive Analysis\r\n\r\nTechniques geared towards summarizing a data set, such as:\r\n\r\n- Mean\r\n- Median\r\n- Mode\r\n- Average\r\n- Standard deviation\r\n\r\n### Inferential Analysis\r\n\r\nTechniques geared towards testing a hypothesis about a population, based on your data set, such as:\r\n\r\n- Extrapolation\r\n- P-Value calculation\r\n\r\n### Qualitative Analysis\r\n\r\nTechniques geared towards understanding a phenomenon, rather than predicting and testing hypotheses, such as:\r\n\r\n- Grounded Theory/[Computational Grounded Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxI6W5IIG74FeEtGbjQ0WF9uM0U/view)\r\n- Content Analysis\r\n- Text Analysis\r\n\r\nAs we have discussed thus far, data are not neutral or objective. They are guided by and produced through our interests and assumptions, often shaped by our socio-political contexts. Hence, we must also understand that the forms of analyses we take to our data further shapes how we are choosing to tell the story. We are crafting a narrative through each of the stages of data that helps us communicate our projects to a wider audience. This is not to say that our analyses are not \"empirical\" or \"scientific\" but a suggestion to make transparent the theoretical foundations and perspectives that are guiding our interpretations. For a more nuanced perspective, consider [The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/2) in *[Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/).*\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nDescriptive analysis helps us summarize a data set.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Analysis\r\n\r\n1. As we consider the types of analysis that we choose to apply onto our data set, what are we representing and leaving out?\r\n2. How do we guide our decisions of interpretation with our choices of analyses?\r\n3. Are we comfortable with the intended use of our research? Are we comfortable with the unintended use of our research? What are potential misuses of our outputs?\r\n4. What can happen when we are trying to just go for the next big thing (tool/methods/algorithms) or just ran out of time and/or budget for our project?\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. I may choose to leave out data that are perceived to be outliers, especially if they differ to much from the \"normal\" curve. I end up representing only those who fall within the \"normal\" curve which may not actually be an equitable representation.\r\n2. The interpretation of the results should align itself with the type of analyses that I ran. In addition, it should be guided in some capacity by previous work in this area to inform my understanding.\r\n3. Potential misuse that I am always concern with is the weaponization of marginalized participants' words and thoughts. I think I remain somewhat uncomfortable with the unintended use of my research because I don't think I can ever consider every circumstances that the analysis can be misused or misquoted. When I was working on an oral history project, I have set up some layers of boundaries to prevent too easy of an access to audio files as an attempt at negotiating access and protection of my narrators.\r\n4. In chasing the next big thing, the original intentions for beginning the project might be lost. For me, making sure that my work is meaningful to my communities is important and the excitement of exploring a new tool can sometimes distract me from this intention. Running out of time and/or budget can also mean that the project may end abruptly, and relationships built could be strained in a haphazard wrap up. This brings me back to making sure that before the project begins to spend a significant amount of time on project planning to reduce the chances of this happening.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Descriptive Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/descriptive-analysis.md)\r\n- [Inferential Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/inferential-analysis.md)\r\n- [Qualitative Analysis](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/qualitative-analysis.md)\r\n\r\n# More Stages of Data: Visualized\r\n\r\nVisualizing your data helps you tell a story and construct a narrative that guides your audience in understanding your interpretation of a collected, cleaned, and analyzed dataset.

Creating a visual for your data is an art form and you can sometimes find yourself spending a significant amount of time looking for the best ways to visualize your data.\r\n\r\nAn example of effective data visualization can be seen in W.E.B. Du Bois [data portraits at the Paris Exposition in 1900](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=%22lot%2011931%22%20NOT%20medal\u0026st=grid\u0026co=anedub\u0026loclr=blogpic), as part of [the Exhibit of American Negroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exhibit_of_American_Negroes_). Using engaging hand-drawn visualizations, he tells the narrative of what it meant to be Black in post-Emancipation America as he translates sociological research and census data to reach beyond the academy. Head [here](https://hyperallergic.com/476334/how-w-e-b-du-bois-meticulously-visualized-20th-century-black-america/) to read more about Du Bois' project.\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Visualizations\r\n\r\nAs we transform our results into visuals, we are also trying to tell a narrative about the data we collected. Data visualization can help us to decode information and share quickly and simply.\r\n\r\n1. What are we assuming when we choose to visually represent data in particular ways?\r\n2. As you may have realized, many of the visualization examples work with quantitative data, as such, how do you think we can visualize qualitative data? (e.g. Word Clouds, Heat Map)\r\n3. How can data visualization mislead us? (for e.g. Nathan Yau discusses [how data visualization can lie](https://flowingdata.com/2017/02/09/how-to-spot-visualization-lies/))\r\n4. How can data visualization help us tell a story? (for e.g. Data Feminism's [On rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/5evfe9yd/release/3?readingCollection=0cd867ef))\r\n5. Can you try to plot the `moSmall.csv` dataset based on the `Artist Gender` variable? What would you have to do before you can plot this graph? How might you explain what your visualization represents?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1. An underlying assumption we make is that the conventions of top-down, left-right is universal or at least universal enough for most folx to understand. This neglects potential right-to-left readers. Certain conventions that use color as a way to represent good and bad (e.g. green as good and red as bad) also assumes that this is an effective differentiation that excludes those who have visual impairments can decipher the data in a similar fashion.\r\n2. Exploring [Voyant-Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) can be a good place to start to see how visualization of qualitative data can look like.\r\n3. Exaggerated differences through the choice of scales on the x and y-axis can misled a casual viewer to think that the data is representing a larger difference than it actually is reporting.\r\n4. Data visualization can help us convey dense information quickly. The casual viewer can glance at the visualization and understand what we are trying to communicate with our data. Data visualization also can be affective device, like the DuBois' examples which helps to tell the urgency of the narrative/story.\r\n5. The difficulty of representing this dataset is how at first glance there's an assumption that gender is binary given that only 2 bars are representing the dataset. Even though the other bar is labeled `Unknown` to suggest that this is not a comprehensive breakdown, I'm not sure how effective it is.\r\n![Plot of media objects in public domain by gender of artist](/images/data-ethics/genderPD.png)\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n# Data Literacy and Ethics\r\n\r\nThroughout the workshop we have been thinking together through some of the potential ethical concerns that might crop up as we proceed with our own projects. Just as we have discussed thus far, we hope that you see that data and ethics is an ongoing process throughout the lifespans of your project(s) and don’t often come with easy answers.\r\n\r\n## Final Activity\r\n\r\nIn this final activity, we would like for you to think about some of the potential concerns that might come up in the scenario below and think about how you might approach them.\r\n\r\nYou are interested in looking at the reactions to the democratic party presidential debates across time. You decided that you would use data from Twitter to analyze the responses. After collecting your data, you learned that your data has information from users who were later banned and included some tweets that were removed/deleted from the site.\r\n\r\nAs you work through this activity, you can definitely choose to do so with your partner! And we highly encourage you to do so! Different perspectives can offer us different insights to our own gaps and help us in thinking through our decisions. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts and ideas when we \"meet\" for our sessions.\r\n\r\n### Some Guiding Questions\r\n\r\n1. What are some reasons you might have for anonymizing (or not) your data?\r\n    - Would your approach differ if the responses were anonymized v. not?\r\n2. Would you remove the data in your initially downloaded corpus?\r\n    - How might you be aware of the differences in the corpus you downloaded v. the most current information?\r\n3. Would the number of tweets generated impact your decisions?\r\n4. How might where you are at in the stages of data (e.g. \"raw\" data v. \"cleaned\" data v. analysed) affect your choices?\r\n\r\n### Some Additional Exploration\r\n\r\n- If you were collecting and/or analyzing data on folx in power, such as looking at the data from [Tweets of Congress'](https://alexlitel.github.io/congresstweets/) project, would that change the way you consider your answers to the previous questions?\r\n- Current [ethical guidelines](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu/content/ethics) from SAFE Lab at Columbia University have decided to alter the text of social media post to render it unsearchable. Why and when would you consider (or not) altering the collected tweets for publication? \r\n\r\n# Some Concluding Thoughts\r\n\r\nData and ethics are contextually driven. As such, there isn’t always a risk-free approach. We often have to work through ethical dilemmas while thinking through information that we may not have (what are the risks of doing/not doing this work?). We have approached a moment where the question is no longer what we could do but what we should do. Given this saturated data-driven world we currently live in, there is value in pausing and consider why and what we are collecting, researching, analyzing, and understanding. Starting on a new project, especially one dealing with \"big\" data can be exciting but we now also have to first consider who does the data collected benefit and [why is it important are important](https://www.manifestno.com/). The IRB (Institutional Review Board)'s regulations may form the starting point of our considerations but should not be the ending point of how we consider contextually-driven ethics and data projects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, open access is not always the answer to concerns of reproducibility and/or ethical considerations. There are moments where the decision to not have a dataset or analysis openly accessible is valid. For example, when you are working with marginalized or vulnerable populations, concerns for causing more harm justifies restricting access. We may choose to control who has access to decrease the chances of misrepresentations (intentional or otherwise) or having results taken out of contexts.\r\n\r\nFor a set of great questions to help you think through your data exploration and project planning, please check out Kristen Hackett's Tagging the Tower post, [What to Consider when Planning a Digital Project.](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/10/30/what-to-consider-when-planning-a-digital-project/)\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\nNow that you've gained an understanding of some of the considerations around data and ethics, let's think a bit further about how you may apply some of what we have discussed in your work.  Below the quiz segment you will find some additional readings that dives deeper into some of the topics that were covered in our lessons.

You've decided to look at the [2018 European Social Survey](http://nesstar.ess.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?v=2\u0026previousmode=table\u0026regMod=corr\u0026submode=variable\u0026analysismode=table\u0026study=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FESS9e02.0\u0026gs=undefined\u0026variable=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FESS9e02.0_V93\u0026mode=documentation\u0026top=yes) and the U.S.-based [2018 General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026user_search_id=\u0026state_id=\u0026search_type=\u0026keyword=politic\u0026doslider=0\u0026yrmin=1972\u0026yrmax=2018\u0026years=2018\u0026subjects=\u0026ssearch=\u0026commit=SEARCH). How would you approach the data? If you're interested in reporting on the trend of global political views, what do you have to consider when you join these data sets? What assumptions do you have to make? How would you collapse responses?\r\n\r\n### Discussion Questions\r\n\r\n- How does increased data literacy add to your project planning? \r\n- How do you address your use of data and your ethics? For example,how might ethics play a part in the way you think about (a) data collection? (b) anonymity and confidentiality? (c) data and its relation to the communities it emerges from?\r\n- Consider your next project, what are some considerations from this workshop that you might bring into your project?","title":"Data Ethics","description":"What is data?

Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a _repository_. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. We will explore these features in the current workshop. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create \"branches\" of a project to explore different futures. These are advanced features, which we will provide resources for you to explore later. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchronously developed and eventually merged with the main project.\r\n\r\n**GitHub** is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highlighting Distinctions\r\n\r\nAs we move forward it's important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the two different tools outlined above.\r\n\r\n**Git** is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local computer like Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\n**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository—as described above—from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich of the following best describes _version control_: (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- a software installed on my local machine\r\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes*\r\n- a language that can be read and rendered by some web-based platforms\r\n- a cloud-based software\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich of the following best describe Git: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- a software installed on my local machine*\r\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes\r\n- a web-based platform for storing and sharing files\r\n- a version control software*\r\n- a cloud-based software\r\n- refers to project folders as \"repositories\"*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich best describes GitHub: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- a cloud-based software*\r\n- a software installed on my local machine\r\n- a web-based platform for storing and sharing files*\r\n- a version control software\r\n- refers to project folders as \"repositories\"*\r\n- the practice of tracking and organizing the state of a file over time, as it changes\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Git](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/git.md)\r\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/github.md)\r\n- [Version Control](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/version-control.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n# What You Can Do with Git and GitHub\r\n\r\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\r\n\r\n- Developing software\r\n- Sharing data sets\r\n- Creating websites\r\n- Writing articles and books\r\n- Collating online resources\r\n- Keeping research notes\r\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\r\n\r\n### Why Use GitHub?\r\n\r\nParticipants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated:\r\n\r\n- Sharing and backing up files on multiple computers\r\n- Monitoring changes effectively\r\n- Recovering from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose\r\n- Using different branches for experiments and new directions\r\n- Sharing and managing files with others—seeing who added what content and when\r\n\r\n## How We Use GitHub\r\n\r\n### Sharing and Attribution\r\n\r\nAs you can see across these sessions, we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing. It also facilitates attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, when it was added, and which projects or materials are derived from others.\r\n\r\n**Case One: This Session**\r\n\r\nIf you [go this to workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git) and look at the top of the page just under the workshop title, `DHRI-Curriculum/git`, you can see it is `forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018` (next to the red star). That line shows that this particular repository is copied from (_\"forked from\"_) the curriculum for a session presented at our January 2018 Institute by \"pswee\" (former Graduate Center Digital Fellow Patrick Sweeney). If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. We'll expand on _forking_ in the final section of this workshop.\r\n\r\n![Image of what attribution looks like in GitHub](/images/git/attribution.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Collaborative Writing\r\n\r\nGit is also used in writing projects! _Version control_ makes tracking changes tractable, especially when there are multiple authors working asynchronously. It can be an alternative to using track changes in Microsoft Word, or comments and edits in a Google Doc.\r\n\r\n**Case Two: Coauthored Publications**\r\n\r\nGit and GitHub—together or independently—support multi-author publishing. Like we have done with the DHRI curriculum, you can have a shared project folder that multiple people are working from asynchronously, even on the same parts if they wanted, and then those different offshoots can be carefully folded back into the main project. A singular author can also create different offshoots on their own, allowing the writer to explore different ways forward. This, combined with version control, allows authors to easily return to and compare older drafts or retrieve sections previously discarded.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to explore these features after you gain a grasp on the fundamentals in the current workshop. You can find resources to do this on the [Theory to Practice](https://dhri-curriculum.github.io/Dhrift/workshops/git/?page=12) page!\r\n\r\n### Versions Across Time\r\n\r\nHow did you initially come by the syllabus you use for your class(es), and did you develop it over time? Many professors borrow and adapt from each other, and most of us probably update our syllabi each semester, even if only a little bit.\r\n\r\nThrough this process, many of us end up with a set of files that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n![Example of a messy folder structure with many files named similarly](/images/git/messy-file-structure.png)\r\n\r\nWhile I probably can tell which version is the \"final\" one, I can not see what was changed along the way or how the different versions vary from each other.\r\n\r\nWith Git, you would save these multiple versions over time as one file, and each version you save includes a note about what has changed so you can easily revert back to an older version if needed.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the file list, you also can not tell who the syllabus originally came from, or if there were contributions from many individuals. Git and GitHub can help make attribution clear, and maintain it over time as the syllabus travels between hands.\r\n\r\n**Case Three: Syllabi**\r\n\r\nIncreasingly we see that faculty are sharing their syllabi on GitHub (example: [DLCL 204: Digital Humanities Across Borders](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204)). Some are even using GitPages that apply a user-friendly interface to their repository to make it easier to access and navigate for their students (example: [Digital History](https://digitalhistory.github.io/)).\r\n\r\nGitHub offers a way of making a course publicly available on the web, and sometimes easier or more intuitive to users than some learning management systems. Git helps track the changes over time.\r\n\r\nWhen the softwares are used together, Git and GitHub also support a collaborative approach to syllabi development. Copying another's project and modifying and remixing the content to meet your needs is a seamless and transparent process. Attribution of specific changes over time is a foundational function of how Git operates; GitHub explicitly renders attribution, making it easy to see who(s) did what. This is one of the attractions of using the platform.\r\n\r\nIn a practical sense, you could search other syllabi on GitHub, and share yours so it could be searched by others. If someone finds a syllabus that includes parts they want to use, they could fork that syllabi to their GitHub account, and download the files to your local machine and edit them there. Any changes could then be added back to the repository on GitHub, thereby sharing your amendments publicly. On GitHub, attribution of who contributed what are transparent. Meanwhile, your amended version would be available for others to modify and re-share.\r\n\r\nEven if you were only working with your own self-created syllabus, like we'll do later in this workshop, Git and GitHub can be useful for tracking your changes without the hassle of multiple files. From one file, you can use Git to compare your current version with older versions; you can also compare and share these different versions on GitHub if you wanted.\r\n\r\nWe will cover these features in-depth in a later lesson in this workshop.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat tasks could Git and/or GitHub offer support to? (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Developing software*\r\n- Creating and sharing data sets*\r\n- Creating websites*\r\n- Writing articles and books*\r\n- Collating online resources*\r\n- Keeping research notes*\r\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Version Control](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/version-control.md)\r\n\r\n# Review of the Command Line\r\n\r\nDuring this workshop, you'll be communicating with GitHub from your local computer via the command line (the Terminal or the Git Bash on Windows). This section reviews some of the basic commands that will also be used in this workshop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the command line, you'll be using your text editor and your browser. Before continuing, its important that we clearly distinguish between these three different spaces or environments:\r\n- Your plain text editor where you'll be writing your syllabus is on your local computer.\r\n- That syllabus is initially saved in a git-enabled repository on your local computer.\r\n- Your browser is where you'll be uploading your repository to GitHub, a cloud service.\r\n- Your terminal is where you'll be communicating with GitHub to send the repository and project files back and forth between the cloud (which you can view through the GitHub website) and your hard drive.\r\n\r\nBecause you'll be moving between these three spaces throughout the workshop, you may want to use (\u003ckbd\u003ecommand (⌘)\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003etab\u003c/kbd\u003e) or (\u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003etab\u003c/kbd\u003e) to move quickly between the three windows on your desktop.\r\n\r\n### Accessing the Terminal\r\n\r\n__macOS__\r\n\r\nHold the \u003ckbd\u003ecommand (⌘)\u003c/kbd\u003e key and press the \u003ckbd\u003espace\u003c/kbd\u003e bar at the same time to bring up the \"Spotlight Search\" window. Type `terminal`, followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e to quickly open the Terminal.\r\n\r\n__Windows__\r\n\r\nPress the \u003ckbd\u003ewindows\u003c/kbd\u003e button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type `git bash` and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e.\r\n\r\n## Practice Navigating the Command Line\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel comfortable navigating your hard drive through the command line, here is a short section catching you up. _If you feel fairly comfortable using the command line, you can skip this section, and go straight to the next one._\r\n\r\nYou can create the folder anywhere on your hard drive by typing the following into your terminal and hitting \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd \u003cdirectory-name\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's practice this command by using it to take us to our Desktop. Type the following command into your terminal and hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will change your current working directory from `/Users/\u003cyour-name\u003e` to `/Users/\u003cyour-name\u003e/Desktop`.\r\n\r\nCheck your current directory by typing the following command into your terminal and hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, use the following command to go up one directory:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck your current directory again using the following command. You should be back in your \"home\" directory:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nPractice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory.\r\n\r\nWhen finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with `pwd`.\r\n\r\n## Making a Projects Folder\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder.\r\n\r\nIf you've worked through the command line session, you should already have a `projects` folder on your desktop. _If you don't have a projects folder on your desktop, create one using the following command_:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mkdir projects\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom `Desktop`, Navigate into your `projects` folder using the following command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd projects\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create a `git-practice` folder with the following command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mkdir git-practice\r\n```\r\n\r\nNavigate into the new `git-practice` folder using the following command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd git-practice\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, when you type `pwd`, your folder structure should look like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ pwd\r\n/home/\u003cusername\u003e/Desktop/projects/git-practice\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich best describes where you are working when you're writing in your plain text editor:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- on my local machine*\r\n- on the internet\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich best describes where you are working when you're using your terminal to communicate with GitHub and share the files:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- on my local machine*\r\n- on the internet\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich best describes where your files are when you are viewing them in GitHub:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- on my local machine\r\n- on the internet*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nGit-enabled repository means: (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- none of the files on my local machine are being tracked\r\n- a specific file on my local machine is being tracked\r\n- a specific folder on my local machine is being tracked*\r\n- all the files on my local machine are being tracked\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich command do you use to make a new folder?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `pwd`\r\n- `cd`\r\n- `mkdir`*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich command do you use to enter into a folder?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `pwd`\r\n- `cd`*\r\n- `mkdir`\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich command do you use to check where you are?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `pwd`*\r\n- `cd`\r\n- `mkdir`\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Setting Up Git\r\n\r\nThrough this section, you'll be checking your installation and configuring Git with your own name and information.\r\n\r\n### Check Your Installation\r\n\r\nFirst, let's make sure Git has been successfully installed. In your terminal, type the following command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see a version number, you're all set. If not, follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md).\r\n\r\n## Configuring Git on Your Computer\r\n\r\nOur first step in working with Git is letting the software know who we are so it can track our work and attribute our contributions. This information is useful because it connects identifying information with the changes you make in your repository.\r\n\r\nType the following _two commands_ into your command line, replacing the \"John Doe\" and \"johndoe@example.com\" with your name and email (use quotations where you see them). These do not necessarily need to be the name and email you used to sign up for GitHub. Remember, these are different spaces and different softwares.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\r\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo check your set-up, type the following command into your terminal:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git config --list\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get something that looks like this except with whatever information you entered previously:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser.name=Superstar Git User\r\nuser.email=gitsuperstar@gmail.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat are you doing when you set up git? (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- You are creating a new version of the software on your local machine.\r\n- You are sending files from your local machine to GitHub?\r\n- You are introducing yourself to the software, so it knows who you are.*\r\n- You are creating a new version of a project folder on your local machine.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Creating a Syllabus File\r\n\r\nThe next step is to _initialize_ the project folder that we want Git to track. Even though we configured Git for our computer, Git doesn't start tracking every single file on our computer. That would turn into a headache quickly. We only want Git to track changes for files within specific folders/projects.  \r\n\r\nWhen we initialize a folder, we are telling Git to pay attention to it. This only needs to happen once because what is actually happening through this process is Git is adding a hidden subfolder within your folder that houses the internal data structure required for version control. After initialization, Git is ready to track the files within the folder. The folder is now considered a Git _repository_.\r\n\r\nFirst, use `cd`, navigate to the `git-practice` folder (inside `projects`). From your home directory, you can do all of them in one command by typing the following into your terminal:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd Desktop/projects/git-practice\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we're going to _initialize_ our repository using the `git init` command, which should generate the following output:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git init\r\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/\u003cyour-username\u003e/projects/git/.git/\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow Git is tracking our directory. However, it has not done any versioning yet. This is because 1) we haven't told Git to take a snapshot yet, and 2) there are no files in the folder to take a snapshot of. For now, Git knows this folder exists and is prepared to take a snapshot of the files when you tell it to.\r\n\r\nBefore version control is useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we will track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.\r\n\r\n## Creating a Syllabus file\r\n\r\nTo create a plain text file, we're going to switch to our text editor, Visual Studio Code, to create and edit a file named `syllabus.md` and save it to our `git-practice` folder. The `.md` extension indicates that it is a Markdown file, which is a special file format we will dive into in the next section.  \r\n\r\nIf you have not installed Visual Studio Code, review [the installation instructions here](https://dhri-curriculum.github.io/Dhrift/guides/visual-studio-code/).\r\n\r\nIn terminal, check to make sure you are in your `git-practice` folder. (_Hint_: use `pwd` to see what directory you are currently in.)\r\n\r\nNext, open the `syllabus.md` file in Visual Studio Code using:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ code syllabus.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a window appear that looks similar to this:\r\n\r\n![Image of what Visual Studio Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file](/images/git/vscode1.png)\r\n\r\nIf Visual Studio Code does not open when you use the `code` command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on macOS as you would any other software. Then click `File \u003e Open File` and use the dialog to navigate to the `/Users/\u003cyour-name\u003e/Desktop/projects/git` folder and create a `syllabus.md` file there.\r\n\r\nWe'll be typing our markdown into this file in the Visual Studio Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003es\u003c/kbd\u003e on Windows or \u003ckbd\u003e⌘\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003es\u003c/kbd\u003e on macOS. Alternatively, you can click the `File` menu on the top right, then select `Save` from the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nSaving frequently is advised. When we get to the version control functionality of Git, only changes that are saved will be preserved when a version is created.\r\n\r\n# Creating Syllabus Content Using Markdown\r\n\r\nWe'll be using **Markdown** to write a syllabus, and then using **Git** to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a `.md` extension.  \r\n\r\n**Markdown** is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.\r\n\r\nWhereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown to render legible documents on GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be easier to write and edit.  \r\n\r\nFor comparison, you learned to create headers in HTML like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ch1\u003eMy Syllabus Heading\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# My Syllabus Heading\r\n```\r\n\r\nA sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n## Readings\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe lessons of this workshop were originally written in markdown. You can see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/v2.0/lessons.md) what they look like in their raw, unrendered form.\r\n\r\nCompare that with this—the source code for this lesson's web page, written in HTML [here](view-source:http://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/git/lessons/).\r\n\r\nMarkdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like `.docx` because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that can change a markdown file to an `.epub` with one command entered into your terminal.\r\n\r\nHere are a few more key elements to get you ready to make your own syllabus in Markdown. \r\n\r\nTo provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n*This text will appear italicized.*\r\n**This text will appear bold.**\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need asterisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.\r\n\r\nTo create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- Reading one\r\n- Reading two\r\n- Reading three\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, directly following the anchor text in brackets. Don't put a space between them:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nI teach at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu).\r\n```\r\n\r\nParagraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nThis is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the \u003cp\u003e tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.\r\n\r\nThis is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nUse these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one `#`), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (`*`) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you want an a more advanced challenge, you can review some additional markdown elements on [this page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add some extra features like images, blockquotes, or horizontal rules.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nYou can look at an example syllabus in raw text form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/main/sections/syllabus.md). You can see what it looks like when it's rendered by GitHub [on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/main/sections/syllabus.md). When editing the markdown file in Visual Studio Code, it might look like this:\r\n\r\n![What your markdown might look like when typed into Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode2.png)\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n1. Visual Studio Code also has a preview feature for your markdown. Hit the preview button on the top right while editing your markdown file:\r\n\r\n    ![Button to hit to get a preview in Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode3.png)\r\n\r\n    You'll get two side-by-side panels. Your markdown file will be on the left, and your rendered preview will be on the right:\r\n\r\n    ![Side by side markdown and preview in Visual Studio Code](/images/git/vscode4.png)\r\n\r\n2.

Now that we have a file to track—our `syllabus.md`—let's use Git to save the current state of the repository as it exists now.\r\n\r\n### A Metaphor for Adding and Committing\r\n\r\nIn Git, a _commit_ is a snapshot of a repository that is entered into its permanent history. To commit a change to a repository, we take two steps:\r\n\r\n1. Adding files to a \"staging area,\" meaning that we intend to commit them.\r\n2. Finalizing the commit.\r\n\r\nStaging a file or files is you telling Git, \"Hey! Pay attention these files and the changes in them\". \r\n\r\nMaking a commit is a lot like taking a photo. First, you have to decide who will be in the photo and arrange your friends or family in front of the camera (the staging process). Once everyone is present and ready, you take the picture, entering that moment into the permanent record (the commit process).\r\n\r\nWhy do you need both steps? Sometimes when you're working on a project you don't want to pay attention to all the files you changed. Perhaps you fixed a bug in some code, but also did some work on your manuscript document. You may want to only commit the changes you made to the code because you still haven't finished your thoughts on the manuscript. You can stage, or `add`, the code file so Git knows to only commit the changes made to that file. Later, you can stage and then commit the manuscript changes on their own once you've finished your thought. \r\n\r\n## Staging Changes with the `add` Command\r\n\r\nFirst, let's see what state Git is currently in. We do that with the `git status` command. It's a good idea to use this command before and after doing anything in a Git repository so you can always be on the same page as the computer.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're in your `/home/\u003cyour-name\u003e/Desktop/projects/git-practice` directory using the `pwd` command in the terminal. Once you're there, enter `git status` and you should see the following output:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch main\r\n\r\nNo commits yet\r\n\r\nUntracked files:\r\n  (use \"git add \u003cfile\u003e...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n\r\n\tsyllabus.md\r\n\r\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Nothing added to commit\" means that we have initialized our repository, but haven't made any commits yet. _If you're instead getting a message that begins with the word `fatal` when you use `git status`, you may be in the wrong directory or perhaps you haven't run the `git init` command on your directory yet._\r\n\r\nLet's follow the recommendation in the status message above and use the `add` command to stage files, making them ready to be committed.\r\n\r\nWe will go ahead and add `syllabus.md` by writing the following in the terminal:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git add syllabus.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see no output from the command line, which should be interpreted as a the above command succeeded. It is what we call \"succeeding silently.\" Let's run `git status` again to have a \"sanity check\"—to make sure that things have changed. You should see output like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch main\r\n\r\nNo commits yet\r\n\r\nChanges to be committed:\r\n  (use \"git rm --cached \u003cfile\u003e...\" to unstage)\r\n\r\n\tnew file:   syllabus.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `new file:   syllabus.md` should be highlighted in green to show that it's ready for commit.\r\n\r\nThis is Git telling you, \"Ok, I see the file(s) you're talking about.\"\r\n\r\n## Committing Changes\r\n\r\nNow that our files have been staged, let's commit them, making them part of the permanent record of the repository. In the terminal, type:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git commit -m \"Initial commit of syllabus file\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `-m` flag provides that the message following the flag (in quotation marks) along with the commit. The message will tell others—or remind a future version of yourself—what the commit was all about. Try not to type `git commit` without the `-m` flag—there's a note about this below.\r\n\r\nAfter running the command, you should see output like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[main (root-commit) 8bb8306] Initial commit of syllabus file\r\n  1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\r\n  create mode 100644 syllabus.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means you have successfully made your first commit in the repository—congratulations! There are a few things going on in this message. The relevant information for you for now is the second line, which tells you that one file was changed, and there were no insertions or deletions. You have a fresh new file! \r\n\r\nLet's check the state of our repository after the commit by running `git status`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch main\r\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that everything in the repository is successfully committed and up-to-date. If you edit your syllabus file or create a new file in the repository, the message you get with `git status` will instead list files that have uncommitted changes.\r\n\r\nLet's run one other command to see the effect our commit has had. Enter this command:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git log\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see output similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommit 8bb8306c1392eed52d4407eb16867a49b49a46ac (HEAD -\u003e main)\r\nAuthor: Your Name \u003cyour-email-here@gmail.com\u003e\r\nDate:   Sun May 20 16:03:39 2018 -0400\r\n\r\n    Initial commit of syllabus file\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the log of commits, comprising a history of your repository. There's only one commit here now, though. If you don't see a prompt (the `$`) after running `git log`, you may need to press the \u003ckbd\u003eq\u003c/kbd\u003e key (just the \u003ckbd\u003eq\u003c/kbd\u003e key by itself) to return to the command line.\r\n\r\n## Why Do We Need to Use the `-m` Flag?\r\n\r\nThe `-m` flag is useful for human purposes and technical purposes. For human purposes, the `-m` flag helps you keep track of the changes you're making. Version control is most useful when you can confidently return to a specific version. It can also help you be more structured in your approach to making changes—your notes to self are limited, so to make them clear, you might make commits after specific tasks are completed. If you update readings for the first week of classes or if you add another reading, you will want to make a commit. This can also make it easier to reverse a specific change in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you type `git commit` by itself, git will open the command line's default text editor to allow you to enter the commit message in a file-like environment. It looks something like this:\r\n\r\n![Example of what the vi screen looks like](/images/git/vi.png)\r\n\r\nThis unfamiliar screen is the default text editor, `vi`, and it requires some knowledge to use. We don't teach it as part of our sessions, but if you find yourself stuck in this screen, you can try this trick to leave that environment and return to your usual command prompt. Type `:q` and then press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. You should be back to the command line with a message saying:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nAborting commit due to empty commit message.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you make a mistake where you include an opening quotation mark but forget a closing one, you might accidentally end up inside a \"quote prompt.\" You will know you're there when your command prompt changes to `quote\u003e`. If this happens, you can just keep writing as much of your commit message as you want, and then end it with the same quotation mark that you opened the commit message with.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to press \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ec\u003c/kbd\u003e on your keyboard, which will exit the quote prompt and cancel any commits you were trying to perform.\r\n\r\n## Pro-tip for the Command Line: How to exit unknown screens\r\n\r\nIf you're ever stuck or \"trapped\" on the command line, try running through these common exit commands to return to the prompt:\r\n\r\n- \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ec\u003c/kbd\u003e\r\n- \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ed\u003c/kbd\u003e\r\n- `q` followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e\r\n- `:q` followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ec\u003c/kbd\u003e attempts to abort the current task and restore user control. \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ed\u003c/kbd\u003e escapes the current shell environment—if you use it at the normal `$` prompt, it will end the current command line session. `q` is often used as a command (followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e) to escape from specific programs like `less`. `:q` is the command used in `vi` that changes the mode of interaction (`:`), allowing you to enter the `q`, a one-letter command to quit, which must be followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Thus, it's a command specific to `vi`.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich best describe the process of _staging_: (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- you telling Git to take a snapshot of changes made to a file.\r\n- you telling Git which files with changes you want it to pay attention to.*\r\n- you telling git to pay attention to a folder storing files you want to make changes to.\r\n- the second part of a two-step process.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhich best describes the process of _committing_: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- you telling Git to take a snapshot of changes made to a file.*\r\n- you telling Git which files with changes you want it to pay attention to.\r\n- you telling git to pay attention to a folder storing files you want to make changes to.\r\n- the second part of a two-step process.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you _stage_ the files, but don't _commit_ them?

Let's connect the directory you created on your local computer to GitHub's cloud service, which you can access through the web.\r\n\r\nRemember, GitHub is a service that allows you to host files, collaborate, and find the work of others. Once our syllabus is on GitHub, it will be publicly visible. (Repositories on GitHub can also be private but are public by default.)\r\n\r\nGo to GitHub in your browser and click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner.\r\n\r\n![You can find the plus sign button to add a repo on the top right of github](/images/git/addrepo.png)\r\n\r\nAfter clicking the plus button, select `New repository` from the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n![The dropdown menu where you select New Repository](/images/git/createrepo.png)\r\n\r\nAfter clicking `New repository`, you'll have to enter some information, including a name and description for your repository.\r\n\r\n![Screen on GitHub where you enter your repository information](/images/git/createrepo2.png)\r\n\r\n- Choose a name, such as `git-practice`. (This does _not_ need to match your folder name although it may be less confusing if you choose the same name here.)\r\n- Enter a description, such as `Test syllabus for learning Git and GitHub`.\r\n- Keep the `Public — Anyone can see this repository` selector checked. (If you choose the Private option, you will need additional steps, not covered in this workshop, to synchronize your GitHub repository with the folder on your computer.)\r\n- Do _not_ select `Initialize this repository with a README` since you will be importing an existing repository from your computer.\r\n- Click `Create repository`.\r\n\r\nYou should end up inside your newly created repository. It will look like a set of instructions that you might want to use to connect your GitHub repository to a local repository.\r\n\r\nThe instructions we want consist of two lines underneath the heading `...or push an existing repository from the command line`. The hand in this screenshot points to where these directions are on the page:\r\n\r\n![The commands you need to copy from the new repo page on GitHub](/images/git/connect-repo.png)\r\n\r\nUse the copy button in the top right corner of the code box to copy all three lines of code. They will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/\u003cusername\u003e/\u003crepository-name\u003e.git\r\n$ git branch -M main\r\n$ git push -u origin main\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need the command copied from your new repository, since it will contain the correct URL.\r\n\r\nPaste them into your command line and press enter. You may need to press enter multiple times to run all three lines of code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\r\nTo https://github.com/\u003cusername\u003e/\u003crepository-name\u003e.git\r\n * [new branch]      main -\u003e main\r\nBranch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see output like this, go back to your new repository page in the browser and click the `Refresh` button. You should see your `syllabus.md` file on GitHub!\r\n\r\n## Review\r\n\r\nWe have covered the basic steps of creating a file and tracking changes within a file on your local machine and on GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis has involved coordinating across three different environments, so let's go through that one more time. Note that this process is very slightly different. I'll highlight it when it comes up.\r\n\r\nTo start, let's add something to our syllabus. Another week of materials or a new reading.\r\n\r\nSave that file.\r\n\r\nUse `git add` via the command line to stage the file—tell Git what document you want it to pay attention to.\r\n\r\nUse `git commit` via the command line to save the changes you've just made as a snapshot or new version of you file. Remember to use the `-m` flag and include a message about the change you just made.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have not done anything with GitHub or on the Internet. We have used Git, installed on our local machine, to save a version of file as it stands now. We could stop here if we only had an interest in using Git for version control. But if we also wanted to use GitHub to back up our files, or to share our project with a team or publicly, we want to upload, or push, that repository to GitHub on the Internet.\r\n\r\nUse `git push origin main` to upload, or _push_, that file to your repository on GitHub. After refreshing the webpage, your file should appear online. **The difference I noted above appears here.** Note the absence of the `-u` flag from the command. That flag was used the first time to establish the connection between the repository on your local machine and on GitHub. Now that that connection has been established, that flag is not needed.\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Go through the process a few more times by adding additional readings and weeks of course material. Remember to commit changes intentionally so your commit messages make sense. Use `git log` to review your changes.\r\n\r\n2. Also try creating a new file and adding an assignment. Rewrite the assignment using Markdown, or edit and add in the markers. Go through the process of staging and committing that file, and pushing it to your repository on GitHub.\r\n\r\n3. Test your understanding by thinking through the following questions:\r\n- Do you need to push the file to GitHub each time you commit changes to the file, or can you make several commits to a file and push them all to GitHub at once?\r\n- Do you need to use `git init` after after adding a new assignment file to your folder?\r\n- What about the `-u` flag in the `git push origin main` command? Does this flag need to be used to add the assignment to your repository on GitHub?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\nIn response to _Challenge 3_:\r\n- No, you don't need to push to GitHub every time, or at all even, if you didn't want to share your changes publicly. Git is the software that tracks the changes, and you review them on your local machine using Git as well.\r\n- No, you don't need to initialize the folder after adding a new file for an assignment or otherwise. In this case, we've already initialized the process; Git is tracking the folder. After the file is added, we just need to notify Git to take a snapshot of the additions and changes using the `git add`, `git commit` sequence. We can also use `git push` to share those changes on GitHub.\r\n- No, the `-u` flag does not need to be used again. This flag is only necessary when setting up the original connection between the folder on your local machine and the folder on GitHub.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich best describes what you're doing when you use the command `git push`?

A key advantage of the platform is that you can find lots of bits of software that do many different things—such as code for plugins for WordPress or Leaflet. Increasingly, you might find syllabi or open writing projects. If a project is public, you can save a copy of it to your local machine, work on it, save your amendations and share it on your own GitHub account. Like we've already mentioned, GitHub usefully helps track attribution along the way.\r\n\r\nCloning and forking are the basic functions of this capability. Each are explained in the following sections, followed by an example and activity to further explain.\r\n\r\n## Cloning\r\n\r\n**Cloning** a repository means making a copy of a repository on GitHub, to download and work on locally—on your local machine. By entering the following code into your terminal, you can clone any public directory on GitHub:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone \u003crepository-url\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you clone a repository from GitHub, the folder that shows up on your local machine comes built-in with a few things. First, Git is already present, so you don't need to initialize the folder. Also, the connection between your local copy and the online repository is already made, so `git push origin main` will work (no `-u` flag needed).\r\n\r\nFor practice, let's clone the repository for this workshop about Git and GitHub, which [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git).\r\n\r\nFirst, let's navigate back to your Desktop folder.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd ~/Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember that the `~` refers to your home directory. Now let's find the URL we need to clone the lesson.\r\n\r\nFirst, visit [this workshop's page on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git).\r\n\r\nOn the main page, there should be a green `Code` button on the right side:\r\n\r\n![Image pointing out where the clone or download button is on GitHub](/images/git/clone.png)\r\n\r\nClick the green button and you will see a box with highlighted text under a heading that says `Clone with HTTPS`. If you instead see `Cloning with SSH`, click the small link that says `Use HTTPS`.\r\n\r\nNow copy out the text in the box:\r\n\r\n![Image showing where the text you need to copy is located](/images/git/copy-clone-text.png)\r\n\r\nNow that you have the text copied, go back to your terminal. Remember, you should be on the `Desktop`. (Hint: Use `pwd` to find out what your current working directory is.)\r\n\r\nOnce you are in the `Desktop`, type:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone \u003ccopied-url\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the command is successful, the full Git and GitHub workshop's text will be replicated on your local machine. To navigate into the folder, its name is `git` and you can use the `cd` command to access it:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd git\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the `ls` command to take a look at the various files in the lesson folder.\r\n\r\nCloning can be especially useful when you're joining a group project that is hosted on GitHub, and you want your changes to eventually be pushed and shared with that same repository.\r\n\r\nBut maybe that is not possible or ideal. Maybe you don't want to contribute your changes to someone else's repository. Maybe you want to make a derivative of their folder for yourself, on your GitHub account, and make changes there.\r\n\r\nForking is the step you could take to do this.\r\n\r\n## Forking\r\n\r\n_Forking_ a repository means making a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, and saving it to your account on GitHub. This function happens within GitHub, and has nothing to do with what is happening on your local machine. Note that _forking_ will not automatically make the repository appear as a folder on your computer; that's the role of _cloning_.\r\n\r\nIn order to \"fork\" the `git` repository into your own GitHub account, follow these steps.\r\n\r\nFirst, go to [the repository for this workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git). Note the `Fork` button in the upper right hand corner. By clicking that button, you can copy, or fork, this repository to your account.\r\n\r\n![Image showing where the button to fork a repo is located](/images/git/fork-button.png)\r\n\r\nDoing so would also adjust the attribution information in the upper left hand corner. Your username would replace `DHRI-Curriculum`, showing that you are looking at a copy of the repository on your account now. Additionally, it will reference the origin account, in this case, `DHRI-Curriculum` below after `forked from`, since this was the origin point of _your_ fork.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the changes in attribution that happen when a repo is forked](/images/git/forking-attrib-chng.png)\r\n\r\nYour local machine would come into play when you want to _clone_ that repository so you can work on it locally. This also means that when you push those changes to GitHub, you would be pushing them to a forked repository associated with your own account.\r\n\r\nYou might use this method if you were going to teach your own Git \u0026 GitHub workshop. You could use our repository as a base for getting started, and add more examples or change some language, clarify something further, or create a connection to another workshop you are giving, etc. This allows us to continue to use the workshop as we have it as well. Also, maybe at a later time, we want to merge some of your changes with ours. We can do that too by revisiting your version history.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\n1. Fork and clone [the repository for this workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git). Note not only _what_ you are doing, but also _where_ you are working when completing these two different tasks.\r\n2. Make changes to the files on your local machine. Remember to save them!\r\n3. Use the 3-step process of stage, commit and push to return the amended files to the repository on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\nRather than write out the solution here, I want to encourage you to go back through the lessons as needed.\r\n\r\nYou'll know you've completed step one when the project folder (called `git`) shows up on your local machine.\r\n\r\nAfter you've made and saved the changes, you'll know you've completed step three when your changes appear in the project folder on _your_ GitHub account.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich best describes _cloning_?

The article also details why and how GitHub works as a collaborative platform.\r\n- Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester's [Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is an online, open-access book on using Git and GitHub within the R programming environment. While most the book emphasizes this use case, the sections \"Let's Git started\", \"IV Git fundamentals\", \"V Remote Setups\", and \"VI Daily Workflows\" are great general resources for expanding your Git knowledge without facing a mountain of material to wade through.  \r\n- Scott Chacon and Ben Straub's whole book [_Pro Git_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is available in open-access format on Git's official website. It is a foundational (albeit long) text that details everything you may want or need to know about working with git on your computer. It also has a section on GitHub for those interested.\r\n- Ei Pa Pa Pe-Than, Laura Dabbish, and James D. Herbsleb has written the article [\"Collaborative Writing at Scale: A Case Study of Two Open-Text Projects Done on GitHub\"](https://ci.acm.org/2019/assets/proceedings/CI_2019_paper_65.pdf), which details how and why git's pull-based model can be used for collaborative writing at scale. In conclusion, they argue that the model helps contributors either _converge_ and work on perfecting one single project, or adopt and tailor an original project to their own needs.\r\n- Keith Miyake, former Digital Fellow at The Graduate Center, has written an introduction on how to [Create Your (FREE) Website Using Github and Jekyll](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2016/03/21/create-your-free-website-using-github-and-jekyll/) on the Digital Fellow's blog _Tagging the Tower_, detailing GitHub's \"pages\" feature that allows you to publish your own advanced website. Using Jekyll, a specific command-line application, you can create essentially unhackable rudimentary websites that are free to host on GitHub.\r\n- On _Programming Historian_, Amanda Visconti has written [\"Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages\"](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) which is an introduction on using GitHub \"pages\" to create a website. Using Jekyll, a specific command-line application, you can create essentially unhackable rudimentary websites that are free to host on GitHub.\r\n- Simon Coll has provided some introductory remarks on why markdown is a good choice for academics in his blog post, [Markdown for Students and Academics](https://www.simondcoll.com/markdown-students-academics/).\r\n- [Steven Ovadia's \"Internet Connection: Markdown for Librarians and Academics\"](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006\u0026context=lg_pubs) is a short article from _Behavioral \u0026 Social Sciences Librarian_ that details the use of markdown as a \"method of divorcing content from formatting.\"\r\n- For those who want an introduction to Creative Commons, a concept introduced in our Git and GitHub introductory workshop, the [Official website for Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) is a good place to start. They also have a [Creative Commons Wiki](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Main_Page) which may be of interest.\r\n- The University of Rhode Island has created [\"Open Licensing with Creative Commons: The Creative Commons Licenses\"](https://uri.libguides.com/creativecommons/licenses), a good introduction to creative commons as a concept with many links to other websites.\r\n- J.R. Dingwall's open-access book [_Creative Commons: An Educator's Course Guide to Creative Commons_](https://openpress.usask.ca/creativecommons) is a good place to start for anyone interested in how the Creative Commons can empower the open education movement with \"tools that help create better, more flexible and sustainable open educational resources (OER), practices, and policies,\" as he writes in Part V of the book, [\"Creative Commons for Educators.\"](https://openpress.usask.ca/creativecommons/part/creative-commons-for-educators/)\r\n\r\n## Other Resources\r\n\r\n- FreeCodeCamp has an excellent introductory tutorial for how to use git on your computer, called [\"An intro to Git: What it is and how to use it\"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/).\r\n- Don't miss Github's official documentation around [Getting Started with GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github). It is detailed and provides more in-depth examples of how to interact with GitHub using your command line.\r\n\r\n### Projects or Challenges to Try\r\n\r\n- Fill in your syllabus repository further, adding not only to your syllabus.md file, but adding additional content such as assignments.\r\n- Create a website from your syllabus files using GitHub Pages or Jekyll.\r\n- Create an independent or collaborative reading group that tracks readings and notes using Git and GitHub. \r\n- Use Git and GitHub to track, store, and share an independent or collaborative project folder. \r\n- Use Git to track a project on your local machine. \r\n- Find and/or modify an existing public project on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Discussion Questions\r\n\r\n- What does your current version control workflow look like and what are the challenges it poses; or how could it be improved?\r\n- How can git support the work you are already doing? \r\n- What additional opportunities does git and/or GitHub and/or Markdown create for your teaching, research or other scholarly work? \r\n- What are the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in the open on the web via a platform like GitHub?

What may be less obvious about websites is that, fundamentally **websites are plain text documents**, usually written in HTML or another web-based markup language, such as XML or XHTML.  \r\n  \r\n\u003cInfo\u003e**Fun fact**: More than 90% of all websites (whose markup language we know) use HTML\r\n[(w3techs.com)](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html/all/all).\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n### Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\r\n\r\nHTML is a markup language used to write web-based documents. It enables us to provide web browsers with information about the _content_ of a document. We can, for example, indicate that some part of our document is a paragraph, image, heading, or link. The browser uses this information when displaying the document for users.\r\n\r\n### Markup Language vs. Programming Language\r\n\r\nHTML is a *markup* language, not a programming language. Programming languages are used to transform data, by creating scripts that organize an output of data based on a particular input of data. A markup language is used to control the presentation of data.\r\n\r\nFor a practical example of this difference, we can think about tables. A programming language can help you search through a table, understand the kinds of data the table includes, find particular data points, or transform its content into other kinds of data, such as frequencies. A markup language would instead determine the content, layout, and visual presentation of the table.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, then, a script or program is a set of instructions given to the computer. A document in a markup language determines how information is presented to a user.\r\n\r\n\u003cInfo\u003e**Markup vs Markdown:** Markdown and HTML are both types of markup languages; Markdown is a play on words. Markup languages help format content.\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\r\n\r\nCSS is usually used in conjunction with HTML. HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document _are_. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should _look like_. It is essentially a set of rules that are applied when rendering an HTML document. Its name—Cascading Style Sheets—refers to the fact that there is an order of precedence in how the browser applies CSS rules to a document. More specific rules overwrite less specific rules.\r\n\r\n### Where Does the Internet Come In?\r\n\r\nTogether, these languages can be used to write and style a website using a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code) directly from your computer. No internet access needed.\r\n\r\nHowever, internet access is necessary if you plan on making your website available to the public. At the end of this workshop, we will briefly discuss [how to get your website from your local computer onto the internet](https://dhri-curriculum.github.io/Dhrift/workshops/html-css/?page=20).\r\n\r\nIn our activities during this workshop we will focus on building locally-hosted websites. These are websites that you can open on your web browser, however, they only exist on your own device and are only accessible to you. Locally-hosted websites are not yet on the internet. \r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nTrue or False: The primary difference between markup languages and programming languages is that markup languages are used to determine the format, appearance, and purpose of content, whereas programming languages are used to transform data.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [CSS](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/css.md)\r\n- [HTML](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/html.md)\r\n- [Markdown](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/markdown.md)\r\n- [Programming Language](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/programminglanguage.md)\r\n\r\n# Opening Activity\r\n\r\n**_Note_: please use Firefox or Chrome. Safari will not allow you to complete this activity.**\r\n\r\n1. Open a web browser, preferably [Firefox](https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/firefox.md).\r\n2. Go to any website. The example below is from [paramajmera.github.io](http://paramajmera.github.io/).\r\n3. Open the secondary menu (using a mouse, this would be the menu that opens when you right click on the page; on Mac computers, this is usually a two-finger tap on the track pad, or you can press the \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e button then click the track pad).\r\n4. Select `View Page Source` from the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n![Image showing dropdown menu that appears when right clicking on a website in Chrome or Firefox](/images/html-css/capture.png)\r\n\r\n### What You Are Seeing\r\n\r\nA second tab should open in your browser displaying the underlying code of the page. This is the code that is used to make and render the page in your web browser.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the page source information and underlying HTML code of a webpage](/images/html-css/capture_pageSource.png)\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we are going to learn how to read and write this code, and render it in the browser on your local computer. At the end we will discuss the next steps for how you could host your new website, making it available for browsing by others via the internet.\r\n\r\n# Basic Template for HTML\r\n\r\nBelow is a basic template for an empty HTML Document.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        ...\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        ...\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML documents start with a `DOCTYPE` declaration that states what version of HTML is being used. This tells the browser how to read the code below it to render the page. If the webpage were written with a different markup language (i.e. XML, XHTML), it would tell you here.  \r\n  \r\nAfter the `DOCTYPE`, we see the start of the **Root Element**. EVERYTHING—all content—that you want presented on this page and all information about how you want that information to be organized and styled goes in the root element, and it is demarcated by `\u003chtml\u003e` and `\u003c/html\u003e`.  \r\n  \r\nThe root element begins by indicating which language the document is written in; and in this basic template, `en` tells us and the computer that we are writing in English.  \r\n  \r\nWithin the root element of the basic template above, you'll notice the two main sections of all HTML documents: a head section (demarcated by `\u003chead\u003e` and `\u003c/head\u003e`) and a body section (demarcated by `\u003cbody\u003e` and `\u003c/body\u003e`).  \r\n  \r\nThe **head section** contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, and so on. This is also where you will link to your CSS stylesheet which describes how you want the page styled—colors, fonts, size of text, and positioning of elements on the page.  \r\n  \r\nThe **body section** contains the content of the page, including paragraphs, images, links, and more, and indicates how this content is to be structured on the page.\r\n\r\n## Activity\r\n\r\nCreate a folder called `htmlpractice` in your projects folder (`~/Desktop/projects/htmlpractice`). Inside that folder, create a new text file and save it as `index.html`.\r\n\r\nLet's use the command line to create the new folder and file:\r\n\r\n1. Open your terminal.\r\n2. Navigate to your projects folder using this command:\r\n\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ cd ~/Desktop/projects\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Create a new folder:\r\n\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ mkdir htmlpractice\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Use your Visual Studio Code text editor to create a file called `index.html`: `code index.html`.\r\n5. Paste the template above (starting with `\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e`) into the new file.\r\n\r\nThe `index.html` file is your default homepage for the website we are creating. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the `index.html` page as the opening page to the directory that is your website. See [here](https://www.lifewire.com/index-html-page-3466505) for more explanation.\r\n\r\nOnce you've created your new file, open it with a web browser using your graphical user interface:\r\n\r\nOn macOS, click on the Finder in your dock (the apps at the bottom of the screen) and click on Desktop on the left. From there, navigate to `projects`, then `htmlpractice`. Alternately, you can click the projects folder icon on your Desktop and find it from there. If you're using a Mac and would prefer to use the command line, you can also type `open index.html` from within your `htmlpractice` folder.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, click the `projects` folder icon on your desktop. Navigate to `projects`, then `htmlpractice`. Double click the `index.html` file. If it does not open in a browser, right click the `index.html` icon and select \"Open with...\" from the menu. Select Firefox or Google Chrome from the app list that appears.\r\n\r\n### What Happens?\r\n\r\nWhen you open the empty template, you'll see only a blank web page. Open your secondary menu (right click on Windows, hold \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e and click with macOS) and view the page source.\r\n\r\n### What Should Happen When I Open Each of my Two New Files?\r\n\r\nWhen you \"View Page Source,\" you should see the code for the basic template.\r\n\r\nNo content renders on the page, because there is no content in the template at this time.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of these two HTML commands is also known as the \"root element\"?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e`\r\n- `\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e`*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Root Element](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/rootelement.md)\r\n\r\n# Tags and Elements\r\n\r\nTags and elements are the structuring components of html webpages.  \r\n  \r\n**Elements** identify the different parts of a page, such as paragraphs, headings, titles, body text, images and more. Elements are demarcated by tags which enclose the content of an element (ex. `\u003chead\u003e` and `\u003c/head\u003e` are tags that denote the head element of your page).  \r\n  \r\n**Tags** demarcate elements in one of two ways. As with the paragraph element below, an element can have an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    This is also a paragraph.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nElements which have an opening and closing tag can have other elements inside them. Inside the paragraph element below is a `\u003cstrong\u003e` element, which emphasizes the included text by making it bold.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    When I came home from school, I saw he had \u003cstrong\u003estolen\u003c/strong\u003e my chocolate pudding.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther elements have self-closing tags as with the `\u003cimg\u003e` (image) element below. These tags are also called **void tags**.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cimg src=\"image.jpeg\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese elements don't require a separate closing tag. Closing tags aren't needed because you wouldn't add content inside these elements. For example, it doesn't make sense to add any additional content inside an image. It is common practice to end void tags like the one above with a `/` to mark the end of it.  \r\n  \r\nBelow is HTML that adds alternative text to an image—or text that describes the image. This information added is an attribute—or something that modifies the default functionality of an element.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cimg alt=\"This is an image\" src=\"image.jpeg\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding alternative text to an image, as was done in this example, is vitally important. That information makes the image more accessible to those viewing your site. For instance, users with poor vision who may not be able to see your image will still understand what it is and why it's there if you provide alternative text describing it.  \r\n  \r\nIf you look back at the basic template in your `index.html` file, you'll see that the main sections of your file have opening and closing tags. Each of these main elements will eventually hold many other elements, many of which will be the content of our website.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following statements is correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Elements have opening and closing tags.*\r\n- Tags have opening and closing elements.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Tag](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tag.md)\r\n- [Elements](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/elements.md)\r\n\r\n# Paragraphs and Headings\r\n\r\nParagraphs and headings are the main textual elements of the body of your webpages. Because these contain content that you want to organize and display on your webpage, these are entered in the body element.\r\n\r\nThe `\u003ch1\u003e`, `\u003ch2\u003e`, `\u003ch3\u003e`, etc. tags denote **headings** and **subheadings**, with `\u003ch1\u003e` being the largest and `\u003ch6\u003e` the smallest.\r\n\r\nThe `\u003cp\u003e` tags denote **paragraphs**, or blocks of text.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n    \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eA boring story\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        \u003ch1\u003e\r\n            Cleaning my boiler\r\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003e\r\n            When I got to my basement that day, I knew that I just had to clean my boiler. It was just too dirty. Honestly, it was getting to be a hazard. So I got my wire brush and put on my most durable pair of boiler-cleaning overalls. It was going to be a long day.\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `\u003ctitle\u003e` is in the `\u003chead\u003e` element, which is where information about the webpage goes. The title doesn't appear on the page, but instead elsewhere in the browser when the page is displayed. For example, in Chrome, the title appears on the tab above the navbar.\r\n\r\n![Image showing where the title appears in the Chrome web browser](/images/html-css/title.png)\r\n\r\nNote also that the elements and tags used in HTML have _meaning_. They provide information about the structure of a web page, showing how its parts work together. Those who make use of assistive technologies such as screen readers rely on this semantic information to navigate the page. Thus, it's important to use elements such as headers only when the information being marked calls for it. Making text large and/or bold for visual effect should be done using CSS. The Mozilla Developer Network has some good [introductory information on semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML).\r\n\r\n## Activity\r\n\r\nUsing your text editor, add the following to your `index.html`:\r\n\r\n- Title\r\n- Heading\r\n- Paragraph\r\n\r\nThen, re-save the file. Open it in your browser again or refresh the page if still opened.\r\n\r\nWhat do you notice about how the information is organized in the webpage? In other words, where are the title, heading, and paragraph text?\r\n\r\n### What Should You See?\r\n\r\nThe heading should appear at the top of the page, followed by the paragraph text. The heading text should be larger. The title should appear in the browser window tab.\r\n\r\n![Image of the boiler example above rendered in Google Chrome](/images/html-css/boiler-example.png)\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to indicate that \"About\" is a subheading in my page, which element should I use?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `\u003chead\u003e`\r\n- `\u003ch2\u003e`*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\nLinks are the foundation of the World Wide Web, and thus are an important component of most websites. Hyperlinking text enables users to move between the different webpages on your site (sometimes in the form of a menu or navigation bar), or connect to other resources or information on other websites.  \r\n  \r\nThe `\u003ca\u003e` tag, or **anchor tag**, creates a link to another document. You can use the `\u003ca\u003e` tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents located elsewhere on the web. You can also use it to link to a particular location on a page—we'll see an example of this in the section on Classes and IDs.\r\n\r\n## Option One: Relative Links\r\n\r\nRelative links take the current page as an origin point and search for other files within the same folder or directory. This method is useful for creating links to pages within your own site.\r\n\r\nThe following appears as a link to the `about.html` page in the same folder as `index.html`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ca href=\"about.html\"\u003eAbout\u003c/a\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn your webpage it will appear as:\r\n\r\n[About](/about.html)\r\n\r\nThis link is asking the browser to look for a file titled `about.html` in the same folder. If a file named `about.html` is not in the same folder, clicking the link will result in a `404` (\"Page Not Found\") error (as this broken link does).\r\n\r\n## Option Two: Absolute Links\r\n\r\nAn absolute link includes information that allows the browser to find resources on other websites. This information includes the site domain—such as `google.com`—and often the protocol—such as `http` or `https`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn your webpage it will appear as:\r\n\r\n[Google](https://www.google.com)\r\n\r\nThis pathway is directing your browser to look online for this text document at the URL address provided.\r\n\r\n## More on Links\r\n\r\nEach example above includes an `href`—a hypertext reference—which is an example of an **attribute**. Attributes offer secondary information about an element.\r\n\r\nThe `\u003ca\u003e` tag, or anchor tag, creates a link. The text within the `\u003ca\u003e` and `\u003c/a\u003e` tags, the anchor text, is what a visitor to the site will see and can click on. The `href=` attribute tells the browser where the user should be directed when they click the link.\r\n\r\nThere is another technical difference between the two options above.\r\n\r\n### Relative vs. Absolute Links: When to Use Which One\r\n\r\nUse relative links when referring to pages on your own site. The main advantage of using relative links to pages on your site is that your site will not break if it is moved to a different folder or environment.\r\n\r\n## Activity\r\n\r\n1. Create a new text file called `about.html` in your `htmlpractice` folder. Copy over the HTML from your `index.html` file, but change the text in the `\u003ch1\u003e` element to \"About.\"\r\n2. In your `index.html` file, add a relative link leading to your \"About\" page.\r\n3. Also add a relative link from your \"About\" page to your `index.html` page. In this link, call your `index.html` page \"Home\" (Reminder: `index.html` is the default homepage)\r\n4. Lastly, include an absolute link to a page of your choosing. Remember that an absolute link includes the protocol (for example, `http:`) and also a domain (for example, `cuny.edu`), such as `http://cuny.edu/about`.\r\n5. Re-save your text files and reopen or refresh them in your browser.\r\n\r\n### Check If It Worked\r\n\r\nWhen your pages are updated, you should be able to navigate from your \"Home\" page to your \"About\" page, and vice versa. You should also be able to navigate to the external web page.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following options is a relative link?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\"\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/a\u003e`\r\n- `\u003ca href=\"digitalProject.html\"\u003eDigital Project\u003c/a\u003e`*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute.md)\r\n\r\n# Images\r\n\r\nImages are another important component of websites. Sometimes these just help bring your website to life, but other times they can help communicate information to users.  \r\n  \r\nImages are created with the `\u003cimg\u003e` tag. Similar to the `\u003ca\u003e` tag, `\u003cimg\u003e` requires an attribute, in this case `src`. The `src` attribute stands for \"source\" and communicates secondary information to your browser that identifies and locates the image. Unlike many other tags, the `\u003cimg\u003e` tag does not need to be closed, making it an example of a void tag.  \r\n  \r\nThe following element pulls in an image located in the same folder as the `.html` file:  \r\n  \r\n```html\r\n\u003cimg src=\"scream.jpeg\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same rules apply here as with the `href` attribute: if the image is not located in the same folder as the document you are writing in, the browser won't find it. If the browser cannot find an image resource, you will see a broken image icon, such as this one from Chrome:  \r\n  \r\n![Chrome broken image icon](/images/html-css/broken.png)\r\n  \r\nNote: Some sites use a lot of images. When this is the case, it can be helpful to keep images in a separate folder within your site's structure. To enable the browser to find an image in that case, just add the directory in front of the file name. For example, if you have a folder named images in the same folder as your index.html file, and scream.jpeg is in that folder, you'd change the void tag above to `\u003cimg src=\"images/scream.jpeg\" /\u003e`.\r\n\r\n## Making Images Accessible\r\n\r\nAs briefly noted earlier, alternative text, or alt text, is descriptive \"text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as the image\" (see [Wikipedia Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative Text for Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images) for more), and is important for ensuring content conveyed by images is accessible to all.\r\n\r\nTo add alternative text to an image, you add an additional attribute, `alt` followed by your descriptive text. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cimg src=\"filename.png\" alt=\"Text in these quotes describes the image\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information about using alt text, see what the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/files/SSA_Alternative_Text_Guide.pdf) has to say.\r\n\r\n### What Images May I Use On My Site?\r\n\r\nIf you're planning to use images that you did not take or make yourself, you'll need to use \"public domain\" or \"open license\" images.\r\n\r\nThis [guide by the OpenLab at City Tech](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/following-copyright-guidelines-for-images/) includes more information on licensure and a list of places where you can find reuseable images.\r\n\r\n## Activity\r\n\r\nDownload and save an image from the web, or move an image from your computer into the same folder as your `index.html` file.\r\n\r\nTip: Give the file a simple name. Also, the name **cannot** have spaces. A good practice is to use either dashes or underscores where there would otherwise be spaces. For example: `this-is-an-image.jpg` or `this_is_an_image.jpg`.\r\n\r\nUsing the code above as a reference, add that image into your `index.html` file, re-save the file, and re-open or refresh the page in your browser. Your image should now appear on the page.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nDoes including \"alt text\" in websites improve their accessibility?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Yes*\r\n- No\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Conventions\r\n\r\nAs we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some common conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. Can you guess any of these?  \r\n  \r\nHere are a few examples:\r\n\r\n- Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. They also generally end with a forward slash (`/`) to mark the end of the tag.\r\n- Use lower case. While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.\r\n- Your code should be nested. This is not a technical necessity either—blank space has no meaning in html. However, this makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors!\r\n\r\n# Major Challenge: Create an Institute Website\r\n\r\nIn this major challenge, we will begin creating an introductory page for your a Digital Humanities Institute in your home institution. Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below), we will make a barebones website that provides information about a Digital Humanities Institute that you might organize.  \r\n  \r\nThe first step is to create a new folder called `website` in your `projects` folder on your desktop. Create an `index.html` as well as an `about.html` file inside that folder. These will be the landing page of your site, and a supplemental page that provides information about your Digital Humanities Institute's organizers.  \r\n  \r\nAdd HTML to your `index.html` file. This page should include the following:\r\n\r\n- Doctype\r\n- Root element\r\n- Head and a body\r\n- Title for the page\r\n- One heading\r\n- One paragraph\r\n- One image with alt text\r\n- A menu or navigation bar that links to your Home and About pages\r\n\r\nThink about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page. Feel free to make up workshops or borrow language from our [Digital Humanities Institute](https://www.dhinstitutes.org/) website.  \r\n  \r\nDon't worry about getting the content just right. The important aspect of this exercise is to review the structure of a webpage, and practice creating a webpage.\r\n\r\n## Additional Tags\r\n\r\nHere are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:\r\n\r\nTo **make a list**, you open and close it with the `\u003cul\u003e` tags, and each item is an enclosed `\u003cli\u003e` tag:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eItem 1\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eItem 2\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eItem 3\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe HTML above will produce an unordered (bulleted) list. To create an ordered (numbered) list instead, just substitute `\u003col\u003e` and `\u003c/ol\u003e` for `\u003cul\u003e` and `\u003c/ul\u003e`.\r\n\r\n(This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar.)\r\n\r\nTo **make a line break** or give space between different elements:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nHere is a more advanced challenge if you're up for it: Add a table containing a schedule of events to your Institute website. You can learn more about making tables using HTML [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).\r\n\r\n# CSS Basics\r\n\r\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This language works in coordination with HTML, but is its own language with its own rules and terminology. In contrast to HTML, which is responsible for the content of the page, CSS is responsible for the presentation of the page.  \r\n  \r\nExamples of what CSS can help you determine include:\r\n\r\n- What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.\r\n- What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.\r\n- How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.\r\n- Where elements appear on the page.\r\n- Whether elements are visible to a user or not.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nIs CSS a markup language or a programming language?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Markup Language*\r\n- Programming Language\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Integrating CSS and HTML\r\n\r\nIn order for CSS to inform the style of the content on the page, it must be integrated with your HTML. CSS can be integrated into your HTML in three ways:\r\n\r\n1. inline\r\n2. internal\r\n3. external (_recommended_)\r\n\r\n## Option 1: Inline\r\n\r\nInline styling adds CSS directly into the HTML of a page to adjust the style of particular parts of a page.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want the text of your first paragraph to be red, but the text of your second paragraph to be blue:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eAbout\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        \u003cp style=\"color: red\"\u003e\r\n            Content of paragraph\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n        \u003cp style=\"color: blue\"\u003e\r\n            Content of paragraph\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Option 2: Internal\r\n\r\nInternal styling also adds CSS directly into the HTML, but keeps it separate from the content code of the page by adding it into the head using the `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag. When using internal styling you are providing styling rules for the entire page. For example, if you want all headings to be blue:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eAbout\u003c/title\u003e\r\n        \u003cstyle\u003e\r\n            h1 {\r\n              color: blue;\r\n            }\r\n        \u003c/style\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        \u003ch1\u003e\r\n            Heading One\r\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003e\r\n            Content of paragraph\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n        \u003ch1\u003e\r\n            Heading Two\r\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003e\r\n            Content of paragraph\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Option 3: External (Recommended)\r\n\r\nExternal styling creates a completely separate document for your CSS that will be linked to your HTML in the head section of your HTML document using the code below. This separate document is called a _stylesheet_ and is often named `style.css`. The document is linked through a void `\u003clink\u003e` tag that lives inside the parent `\u003chead\u003e` tag. Its `href` attribute is a relative link to the document somewhere in relation to the document that references it.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eCSS Example\u003c/title\u003e\r\n        \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        ...\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\nIt's best practice to use Option 3, external styling, for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It helps us remember what each language focuses on: HTML is for _content_, CSS is for _styling_. (This is sometimes referred to as the principle of [\"separation of concerns\"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/))\r\n2. It helps us maintain consistency across the various pages of our site as _multiple HTML files can link to the same stylesheet_.\r\n3. Because multiple HTML files can link to the same CSS file, it's not necessary to write the same CSS code multiple times. Once suffices. (This is sometimes referred to as the [\"Don't Repeat Yourself\" principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), or simply _DRY_.)\r\n\r\nOption 3, external styling, is preferred by most web developers because it's more manageable and because it lends itself to greater consistency across the entire site.\r\n\r\n## Challenge: Activity\r\n\r\nCreate a blank stylesheet using the command line (following option 3, external styling, described above). In your `index.html` document, link to your style sheet and re-save the file.\r\n\r\nTo link your stylesheet with your `index.html` file, insert the following code into the head element of that `index.html` file:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nIs the following code-snippet an example of inline styling or internal styling?  \r\n  \r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eHomepage\u003c/title\u003e\r\n        \u003cstyle\u003e\r\n            h1 {\r\n              font-family: monospace;\r\n            }\r\n            p {\r\n             font-family: fantasy;\r\n            }\r\n        \u003c/style\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cbody\u003e\r\n        \u003ch1\u003e\r\n            Online Library for All!\r\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003e\r\n            Free books here!\r\n        \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Inline Styling\r\n- Internal Styling*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Rule Sets\r\n\r\nCSS is based on selectors and declarations, which together form rule sets (or just \"rules\"). Rule sets comprise an external styling file with a `.css` extension. Here is the contents of a sample `.css` file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nh1 {\r\n    color: orange;\r\n    font-style: italic;\r\n}\r\n\r\np {\r\n    font-family: sans-serif;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#navbar {\r\n    background-color: yellow;\r\n    padding: 80px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.intro {\r\n    font-family: arial;\r\n    background-color: grey;\r\n    color: dark-grey;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first rule (which starts with the `h1` selector) applies to all `\u003ch1\u003e` tags on each page where your HTML document links to your stylesheet, and changes the font style and display of those headings.  \r\n  \r\nThe lines within the curly braces (i.e. `{ ... }`) are called **declarations**, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a **property** and ends with a semicolon (`;`).  \r\n  \r\nNote the different syntax being used to select items for for styling with rule sets. The bottom two selectors are used to apply rule sets to **IDs** and **classes**. In general, adding classes and IDs to HTML elements allows for more specific styling—more on these soon!\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the CSS rules above into your `style.css` file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your `index.html` file in your browser and see what happens.  \r\n  \r\n### What should happen?\r\n  \r\nThe formatting of the text on your page should change accordingly. Your `\u003ch1\u003e` should be orange and italic, for example.  \r\n  \r\nWhat are some other rules you might set for different HTML elements? Do a quick Google search for a CSS rule that changes the appearance of your page, such as putting a border around an element.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nHow do we associate a CSS file with an HTML page?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- By including a link to the CSS file in the HTML page's `\u003chead\u003e` element.*\r\n- By putting the CSS file in the same folder as the HTML page.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [CSS Selectors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/cssselectors.md)\r\n- [Class](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/class.md)\r\n- [ID](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/id.md)\r\n\r\n# Filtering\r\n\r\nSome of you may be wondering whether it matters what order you add the rule sets to your `style.css` document. The answer is no. CSS has an automatic filtering function where **the most specific rule in CSS always takes precedence.**  \r\n  \r\nSo if your stylesheet contained the following rule sets:\r\n\r\n```css\r\np {\r\n    color: green;\r\n}\r\n\r\np strong {\r\n    color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then the text of your paragraph would be green, but where the strong tag is found in the paragraph, the text would be bold and red. In other words, the more specific styling for the `\u003cstrong\u003e` text in your paragraph will override the less specific styling of the paragraph in general. This would occur **regardless of the order these rule sets appear in the stylesheet.**  \r\n  \r\nThis rule also applies to how you integrate CSS into your HTML to style your content. For example, if you link to an external stylesheet, and you add inline or internal CSS into your HTML, the inline or internal CSS will override the rules set in the external stylesheet. Similarly, the inline CSS will override the internal CSS.\r\n\r\n# Classes and IDs\r\n\r\nClasses and IDs enable more fine-grained styling by allowing you to define your own selectors. The difference between classes and IDs is that IDs are unique, used to identify one specific element or part of an element, whereas classes are used to identify multiple instances of the same type of element.  \r\n  \r\nBasically, if you're styling a part of your page that is unique, such as the navbar or footer, use an ID. If you're styling something that recurs in different places, like an info box or form field, use a class.  \r\n  \r\nIncorporating classes and IDs into the styling of your document includes two steps:\r\n\r\n1. Some HTML code that CSS selectors can refer back to must be added to your HTML document.\r\n2. CSS rules that select that code must be added to your style sheet.\r\n\r\nThe code for classes and IDs is different in both CSS and HTML.\r\n\r\n## HTML Code\r\n\r\nIn HTML, classes and ids are added to the first part of a tag. Here's an example of what HTML code with classes and ids looks like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cul id=\"navbar\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eHome\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eAbout\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003ch1 class=\"football\"\u003eFootball teams\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"football\" id=\"colts\"\u003eIndianapolis Colts\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"football\" id=\"packers\"\u003eGreen Bay Packers\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003ch1 class=\"baseball\"\u003eBaseball teams\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican League teams\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"baseball american\" id=\"twins\"\u003eMinnesota Twins\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"baseball american\" id=\"tigers\"\u003eDetroit Tigers\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eNational League teams\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"baseball national\" id=\"dodgers\"\u003eLos Angeles Dodgers\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli class=\"baseball national\" id=\"mets\"\u003eNew York Mets\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible to assign more than one class to an element—just leave a blank space between the two classes, as in the baseball examples above.\r\n\r\nBonus: ID selectors can be used to create links that can be used for navigation _within_ a page. For example, to add a link to the page that takes the user directly to the line that reads \"New York Mets,\" we might write a HTML link like this: `\u003ca href=\"#mets\"\u003eMets\u003c/a\u003e`.\r\n\r\n## CSS Selectors\r\n\r\nClass selectors in CSS are denoted with a period in front of the class name you're creating. They look like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#navbar {\r\n    padding: 80px;\r\n    background-color: red;\r\n    color: white;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.football {\r\n    font-family: arial;\r\n    background-color: lightgrey;\r\n    color: blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.baseball {\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    color: green;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.american {\r\n    background-color: yellow;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ID Selectors\r\n\r\nID selectors look like this in the CSS—the name of the selector preceded by a hashmark (`#`) (also known as a pound sign or octothorpe):\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#navbar {\r\n    background-color: yellow;\r\n    padding: 80px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and in the HTML they are incorporated into elements like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cul id=\"navbar\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eHome\u003c/li\u003e\r\n    \u003cli\u003eAbout\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO: Figure out how to link to the correct section with either the h1 or h2 structuring.\r\n\r\n\u003cInfo\u003e__Tip__\r\n\r\nIf you run into an error, be sure to check your punctuation. Oftentimes the problem is a typo, or overlooking a semi-colon, a period, etc. See the [Troubleshooting](/document/html-css.md/?page=58) section for more information on common issues.\r\n\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nTrue or False: Classes are used to create categories of related elements, IDs are used create unique identifiers.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [CSS Selectors](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/cssselectors.md)\r\n- [Class](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/class.md)\r\n- [ID](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/id.md)\r\n\r\n# Useful Properties\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of useful properties that can be modified with CSS, compiled by Digital Fellow [Patrick Smyth](http://smythp.com). There are also [CSS cheatsheets](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet.pdf) available online.\r\n\r\n### Color\r\n\r\nDetermines text color. Can be a word or a hex value, like `#FFFFFF`:\r\n\r\n```css\r\ncolor: blue;\r\ncolor: #000000;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Background Color\r\n\r\nSets the background color of an element.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbackground-color: pink\r\nbackground-color: #F601F6;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Text Align\r\n\r\nAligns text to the left, center, or right.\r\n\r\n```css\r\ntext-align: center;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Padding\r\n\r\nThe space between contents and the \"box\" (`\u003cdiv\u003e`) surrounding it.\r\n\r\n```css\r\npadding: 10px;\r\npadding-right: 10px\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Margin\r\n\r\nThe space between an element's box and the next element (or the edge of the page).\r\n\r\n```css\r\nmargin: 10px;\r\nmargin-top: 10px;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Width and Height\r\n\r\nSets the width or height of an element.

Usually best to set it to `none`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nlist-style-type: none;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Font Family\r\n\r\nSets the font. Usually best to copy this from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or another web font repository.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nfont-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Major Challenge: Styling Your Institute Website Using CSS\r\n\r\nUsing the CSS basics we've just reviewed, and the list of properties found on the [Properties page](15-properties.md) and online, give your website some styling.  \r\n  \r\nI encourage you to use an external stylesheet with classes and IDs to style particular aspects of your site more specifically, but feel free to also play around with inline and internal styling if desired.\r\n\r\n- Change the color and size of your heading text.\r\n- Change the font of your paragraph text.\r\n- Change the background color of your navigation bar or menu.\r\n- Center your image on your page.\r\n- [Shape up your navigation bar.](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/html-css/blob/v2.0/sections/_navbar-hint.md)\r\n  \r\n**Reminder:** After creating a stylesheet, you must link it to all HTML documents that you want this styling to apply to. You can do so with the `\u003clink\u003e` tag:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will tell your HTML document to apply the style rules from the text file named `style.css` in the same folder.\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nIt is common—especially in the beginning—that you'll add or amend something to/in your text editor, but it won't present when rendered by your browser.  \r\n  \r\nYour first inclination should be to scan the text in your editor for errors. Nesting will help tremendously with this task. Oftentimes it is as little as forgetting a semicolon or closing tag.  \r\n  \r\nAnother investigative tactic is to **View Page Source** on the page opened in the browser.  \r\n  \r\nIf you think it is an **error with the HTML**, you'll be able to see it there.  \r\n  \r\nIf you think it is an **error with the CSS**, then from the Page Source you'll need to click on the link for the `style.css` page. The link to this page should be found in the head of your page. Don't see it? That may be the problem! If you do see it, open the link to see what CSS the browser is reading and applying to your HTML. It should match what you have in your text editor. If it looks like an earlier version of your style sheet, then maybe you need to re-save the document.\r\n\r\n# Workshop Summary\r\n\r\nThrough this workshop, you have learned the basics of two of the most commonly-used languages for building on the web: HTML and CSS.  \r\n  \r\nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, organizes content on your page using elements denoted by tags (`\u003c...\u003e`). When rendered by your browser, these tags tell your browser that certain content is paragraph text, while other content is heading or title text, and so on. You can also use image (`\u003cimg\u003e`) and link or anchor (`\u003ca\u003e`) tags to tell the browser to render an image on the page, or take the visitor to another page on your or another website. We also discussed some important conventions to consider when creating HTML documents, such as nesting.  \r\n  \r\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows for further styling of your website through the application of a series of rule sets that are applied to different aspects/elements of your site. In order for CSS to render on a webpage, it must be integrated with your html, which can happen in three ways: inline, internal, and external. CSS rules can be of varying specificity, and in particular, through creating classes and IDs. We also discussed how the ordering of rule sets doesn't matter, because an important function of CSS is the way it filters and applies rules in accordance with the specificity of the rule.  \r\n  \r\nThrough understanding these languages in combination with one another, you can also reframe your understanding of the web—not as _poof! magic!_, but as a series of intentionally styled, hyperlinked text documents, with each website representing a folder of documents.  \r\n  \r\nWhile this is a good starting point, one important question remains: how can I get these text documents on the Internet so they can be accessed, and interacted with, and linked to by others? This is what we will discuss in the final lesson of this workshop.\r\n\r\n# Making your Website Public\r\n\r\nGreat job! Now you have an amazing website, but it's stuck on your computer where no one else can find it or view it. How do you get your website onto the Internet so it can be shared?  \r\n  \r\nTo get your site on the internet, you'll need **hosting**—that is, a remote computer that will stay on day in and day out to serve the website to visitors. In theory, you could host your website on your own computer, but in practice, it usually makes sense to purchase hosting from a hosting company or use a free service.  \r\n  \r\nYou'll also need a way of getting your website to your host. That's where FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, comes in.\r\n\r\n## FTP\r\n\r\nFTP is a protocol used to share files from your computer (_a client_) to another computer called a server, and back again over the Internet. This is something we do _all the time_, but we refer to it as \"uploading\" and \"downloading.\"  \r\n  \r\nNote: Though FTP stands for file transfer protocol, you are not really transferring or moving your files from your computer; instead they are _copied_ to the server. Fear not!  \r\n  \r\nIn order to transfer your website files (also called your website's directory) to a server you will need:\r\n\r\n1. Access to the Internet.\r\n2. An FTP Client.\r\n3. A server that is connected to the Internet where you can send your files.\r\n\r\nAssuming you all can manage accessing the internet on your own, let's focus on the latter two.\r\n\r\n### FTP client\r\n\r\nAn **FTP client** is software designed specifically for the purpose of sharing files between computers. There are widely-used, freely-available GUI applications (i.e., applications that use a graphic user interface, or the point-and-click, user-friendly software interfaces you are used to) that you can download for use, including [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). You can also run an FTP client program through the command line on most computers, though the process varies by operating system.\r\n\r\n### Other Resources about FTP\r\n\r\n- [FTP for Beginners, *Wired*](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/ftp_for_beginners/)\r\n- [The Three Best FTP Clients for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-ftp-clients-windows/)\r\n- [How To Use FTP Through the Command Line in Mac OS X](http://www.techradar.com/how-to/software/operating-systems/how-to-use-ftp-through-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x-1305664)\r\n- [How to Use the Mac Terminal as an FTP or SFTP Client](https://beebom.com/how-to-use-mac-terminal-ftp-sftp-client/)\r\n\r\n## Web Hosting\r\n\r\nYou also need a server to transfer your files to, where they can be stored and shared on the Internet. This is what we call **web hosting** and there are multiple options here as well. The GCDI (CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives) website contains a list of [low-cost cloud hosting services for students](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-resource-guide/#cloud). As long as your site is just plain HTML and CSS, it's also possible to host your website for free on services such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\r\n\r\n### Guides to Web Hosting Services\r\n\r\n- [The Best Web Hosting Services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-web-hosting-services/)\r\n- [Top 7 Easy and Free Web Hosting Services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-7-easy-and-free-web-hosting-services/)\r\n- [10 Ways That Free Web Hosting Is Bad for Your First Website](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-web-hosting-is-bad/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [FTP](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/ftp.md)\r\n- [Web Hosting](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/webhosting.md)\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\nThis workshop has provided an introduction to HTML and CSS. Through its discussion of tags, elements, and attributes, we have tried to cover the basic ways in which web pages are initially constructed in plaintext and then rendered on browsers. As we concieve of digital humanities projects, however, our visions quickly exceed the capacity of the commands that was covered in this workshop. Not only might we be interested in making information public on the internet, but we might also be interested in providing tools that facilitate interactivity and ease of use with the content that we are curating. Building these tools and incorporating them in our websites requires the additional knowledge of languages like Javascript, SQL, and [Python](http://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python), among many others. Digital humanities projects are often collaborative endeavors and bringing someone into the project who has these skills is an effective way to building well-designed websites.  \r\n  \r\nAnother way to build more complex design and functionality into your websites is by using a Content Management System (CMS), which refers to a suite of tools that facilitates easy website development and hosting on the internet. Most modern-day websites require functionalities that strains the limits of HTML and CSS. Content Management Systems allow users without any familiarity with advanced web-design languages and concepts to quickly build websites that are visually appealing and contain a variety of features. CMS platforms often provide a variety of tools that users can simply click, drag, and input content to create websites. No coding required! Popular content management systems in the digital humanities include [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/), [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/), [Libguides](https://www.springshare.com/libguides/), and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). These CMS have robust documentation and an active user community, both of which can help solve issues in website development. The suggested readings and tutorials provided below link to more information on selecting and using a CMS.\r\n\r\n## Review your knowledge: 10 questions from the lessons\r\n\r\n__1.

This entry from the DARC wiki introduces the concept of Content Management Systems and raises a number of factors that influence which one is better suited for your project.\r\n\r\n- [“Choosing a Platform for Your Project Website”](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog/13/12/04/choosing-platform-your-project-website), _Digital Humanities at Berkeley_. This post provides a thicker description of Content Management Systems. It raises factors such as functionality, familiarity, community, support, and cost when choosing a particular platform on which to build a website.\r\n\r\n### Theories\r\n\r\n- Vincent Brown, [“Mapping a Slave Revolt: Visualizing Spatial History through the Archives of Slavery”](https://doi.org/10.1215/01642472-3315826) _Social Text_ 33, no. 4 125 (2015): 134–41. This is a scholarly article that provides insight into how websites are used as digital humanities research tools. In this article, Vincent Brown describes the [_Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760–1761: A Cartographic Narrative_](http://revolt.axismaps.com/) project, a digital archive and interactive map of Tacky's Rebellion. The article explores the potential of the digital in enabling a \"rhetorical practice that can define, clarify, and advocate visions of the world that might otherwise go unarticulated.\"  \r\n\r\n- Elizabeth Maddock Dillon, [“By Design: Remapping the Colonial Archive”](https://doi.org/10.1215/01642472-3315838), _Social Text_ 33, no. 4 125 (2015): 142–147. This scholarly article also discusses the [_Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760–1761: A Cartographic Narrative_](http://revolt.axismaps.com/) project, a digital archive and interactive map of Tacky's Rebellion. Elizabeth Maddock Dillon argues for the centrality of the question of design in building websites. Dillon underscores the importance of thoughtful attention to the arrangement of imagery and text, the choice of iconography used to express information, and the form of data visualizations when creating online digital humanities projects.\r\n\r\n## Other Tutorials\r\n\r\n- [W3School HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) provides an indepth overview of HTML and introduces a number of commands and protocols not covered in our introductory workshop.  \r\n\r\n- [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) covers a lot more ground with CSS and provides very helpful \"how to\" guides for making menus and integrating with other websites.\r\n\r\n- [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) is a platform for building digital archives and digital exhibits. It is designed to help those without deep technical knowledge build simple interactive websites. Instead of using HTML and CSS, Omeka provides a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for building websites. Omeka is a wonderful point of beginning to understand how a content management system works. Graduate Center Digital Fellow and digital archivist, Stefano Morello, has put together a very helpful workshop on [getting started with Omeka](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/omeka).\r\n\r\n- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most widely used content management service. Similar to Omeka, it provides a Graphical User Interface for building websites. However, unlike Omeka, Wordpress provides many additional functionalities that vary in their use, scale, and complexity. Wordpress can be used to make a variety of different kinds of websites, from course-websites to scholarly publications, and much more. The [Wordpress Turorial for Beginners](https://wordpress.com/learn/) provides a helpful introduction to this tool. \r\n\r\n- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be useful to more advanced users for hosting HTML/CSS files and publishing them directly on the internet. It draws on a Github repository to build static websites. Websites that are hosted on Github pages tend to have a URL that ends in `github.io`. The official Github documentation has a well written guide on [creating a Github Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Projects or Challenges to Try\r\n\r\n### Build a Course Website\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to help you practice the HTML/CSS fundamentals covered in this workshop. The goal of this project will be to create a locally-hosted course website using HTML and CSS that contains the following:\r\n\r\n- Course Description \r\n- Readings\r\n- Schedule of Classes\r\n- Assignments\r\n- Instructor's Contact Details and Office Hours\r\n- Menu that allows users to navigate the different sections of the website.\r\n\r\nYou are free to decide how this information is presented and styled in your website. You could put all of the information in a single page. Alternatively, you might consider making different pages for each aspect of the course website. However, as you develop your website, be sure to cover the following key aspects of thoughtful website design:\r\n\r\n- All links should be correctly formatted and point in the right direction.\r\n- Include alt-text with all images.\r\n- Ensure that your use of color, font, and images facilitates ease of access for those with disabilities. \r\n\r\nTo begin, create a folder called \"courseWebsite\" in your working directory. This folder will contain your index.html file, any other HTML files you create for additional pages, any CSS files you use to style your website, as well as images that you would like to use in your Course Website. Now its time start using elements, attributes, classes, IDs, and all the other aspects of HTML and CSS to start building your website!\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure of which HTML/CSS commands to use, check out the [HTML Cheat Sheet](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php) and the [CSS Cheat Sheet](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet.pdf), which provides a quick reference guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion Questions\r\n\r\n1. In this workshop, we have focused on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The point was to provide an introduction to the workings of websites. In practice, however, the websites that we desire to build will have complex use cases. What are some websites that you imagine building? What kinds of interactive features would you like to have in your website?\r\n\r\n2. Some websites provide information clearly and in an engaging manner. Others might inundate with a barrage of content that leaves one mystified. What would you say are some of the characteristics of well-designed websites? Which websites do you consider a joy to use? What design elements (such as font, color, layout, and menus) stand out to you as being particularly important in making good websites? ","title":"Introduction to HTML and CSS","description":"HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create and organize the content of a website.

Later on, we will be working with R in a more robust way, executing longer R scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nx = 5  # radius of a circle\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npar(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))\r\nplot(cars, pch = 19)\r\nplot(pressure, pch = 17)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it first shows the current Python version along with some hints for help or licensing information. Next, you will see three very important greater-than signs: `\u003e\u003e\u003e`. \r\n\r\nThese greater-than symbols `\u003e\u003e\u003e` are how you know that you have entered an interactive session with Python, as distinct from the normal `$` terminal prompt (or `%` if you are on MacOS). Let's work with this environment a bit.\r\n\r\n## A Little Math\r\n\r\nLet's try a little math in the Python prompt. In the Python REPL environment below \u003cspan style = \"color:green\"\u003e(shown in green text)\u003c/span\u003e, type the following mathematical operations after the Python prompt (the `\u003e\u003e\u003e`), and hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e after each operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\n    1+1\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should see the text `Hello World!` appear in the output below the code editor in the shell.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\n    1+2\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n","title":"Introduction to R","description":"R is an increasingly popular language for data analysis, especially in academia.","programming_language":"R","learning objectives":["Familiarize you with R language","Understand R syntax, logic, and"],"facilitators":{"name":"Leanne Fan","description":"Here is a short bio."},"estimated time":["3 - 4 hours"],"dependencies":{"workshop prerequisites":{"command-line":{"description":"Introduction to the Command Line (Required) This workshop makes reference to concepts from the Command Line workshop, and having basic knowledge about how to use the command line will be central for anyone who wants to learn about programming with Python.","required":true},"data-ethics":{"description":"Data Ethics (Recommended) This workshop will give you a basis for thinking through the ethical considerations of your programming projects.","recommended":true}}},"authors":["Yuxiao Luo","Leanne Fan"],"editors":["Di Yoong","Lisa Rhody","Stephen Zweibel"],"ethical considerations":["understanding where your data comes from","carefully drawing conclusions","relationship between theory and data anlaysis"],"projects":{"description":"Projects that use the skills you'll learn in this workshop:","The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Tracker":{"description":"The data presented here is based on the Fossil-Fuel Non-Proliferation Database which semi-automatically searches the internet to identify existing climate change supply-side policies.

This is *The JavaScripting Masters Student*, a course designed particulary for graduate students who are not pursuing a degree in computer science. The course is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of programming and to help you get started on your own projects. The course is __not__ intended to be a comprehensive introduction to computer science concepts, but rather a step-by-step path to making something useful.\r\n\r\n## Learning Outcomes\r\n\r\nBy the end of the semester, successful students will\r\n\r\n- Gain capacity to read and write JavaScript at a beginner level.\r\n- Understand the core programming concepts, including variables, loops, and conditionals.\r\n- Distinguish among five core data types—integers, floats, strings, booleans, and arrays.\r\n- Engage with error output and use the internet and documentation to independently research language features.\r\n- Be familiar with JS libraries like Leaflet and JQuery.\r\n- Create a small project of their own that can live on the web!\r\n- Be ready for further classes that require JavaScript knowledge.\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- ## What am I doing here? Why Learn JavaScript?\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of meaning that question:\r\nMORE\r\n\r\n \r\n1. JavaScript is a good first language to learn.\r\n\r\n\"JavaScript is the language of the web\". You will have heard that, perhaps. MORE\r\n\r\n2. Learning JavaScript means learning an adaptable language that can be used to bring your work to people on the web.\r\nMORE --\u003e\r\n\r\n## The Process of Learning a Language\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to learn a language. In the case of human languages, the most effective is said to be full immersion. It can be very motivating to be put in a situation where learning is aligned well with a concrete goal, in this case communicating with the people around you.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, learning a programming language benefits from having a specific aim, typically a project built in that language. The problem, though, often ends up being that new learners do not know what is possible to do with a language, so it's hard to develop a clear and realistic goal. In order to help learners along their path, this course is designed as a guided process of project-oriented learning. At the end of this text, you will have finished a small project that you can put on the web, therefore getting some idea of what you can do with the language.\r\n\r\n## Cool, Inspiring Libraries\r\n\r\nWhat's possible with JavaScript? You can use it to create a map, a data visualization, a website, or any number of things. Below are a few examples of powerful tools that you can use to create your own projects. We will be exploring one of these, Leaflet, later in the course.\r\n\r\n- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)\r\n- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)\r\n- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\r\n- [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)\r\n\r\n## JavaSCRIPT, not Java\r\n\r\n\r\nA fundamental part of learning how to program is becoming familiar with the meanings of specialist words in common use. The first thing that trips up a lot of beginners is the name of the programming language, \"JavaScript\". Often new learners will see references to \"Java\" and \"JavaScript\" and think that they are referring to the same language. They are not! But you would be forgiven for thinking so. The confusion could very nearly be called intentional! A bit of history:\r\n\r\nJava is a programming language that became popular in the 1990s. It was used primarily for desktop applications, but as the web became a bigger deal, Java was positioned as the language of choice for web development. The creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich, wanted to hitch a ride on the success of Java and associate his new language with the more established one. Hence, \"JavaScript\". Other than the name, there is no association between the two.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis material is modeled off of [The JavaScripting English Major](https://the-javascripting-english-major.org/v1/contents) by Moacir P. de Sá Pereira. Its pragmatic approach to teaching programming inspired our own, particularly in the project-oriented design of the course. Similarly [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke demonstrated to us a step-by-step accretive method of learning that feels fitting for an audience of non-CS majors. We were also influenced by [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw, in his emphasis on engaging the reader in actual typing and not just memorizing syntax. \r\n\r\n# Getting Started with JavaScript\r\n\r\nLet's begin our journey with the JavaScript language. As is tradition, we're first going to explore some ways to print a \"Hello World!\" message as output to the screen. In doing so, you will be introduced to the basics of working with the JavaScript console. As will become clearer, you can think of the console as an interactive way to run JavaScript commands in your browser. \r\n\r\nTo become further acquainted with the console, we will end the lesson by exploring some fundamental data types and variables in JavaScript, and ways you can use these capabilities to calculate and display a variety of conditions.\r\n\r\n## Hello, World!\r\n\r\n### Alerts\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic ways to output a message is to use the `alert()` method. This method will display a message to the user visiting your web page, and then wait for the user to click on the \"OK\" button.\r\n\r\nTo create an alert, you can write the following line of code...\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nalert(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n...into the box below, where you can see an instance of the interactive console that we have provided for you. If you click your mouse after the `\u003e` symbol (called the _prompt_), you can begin writing your code, and then hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it.\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should now see a pop-up box that displays your message. __Note__: If you do _not_ see a pop-up message, you may need to disable your pop-up blocker.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message on the current webpage. This being the case, it is wise to avoid overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing other parts of the webpage until the box is closed. It is best used as a kind of warning message. For instance, you may have seen developers use it to notify the user that they are heading to a new external website after clicking a link.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that our message is enclosed in `()` (parentheses) as well as `\"\"` double quotation marks. You'll understand why as we continue: this indicates part of the _syntax_, or the rules that define the structure of the JavaScript language.\r\n\r\nYou will also notice that there is a `;` (semicolon) after the `alert` command. Not including the semicolon won't throw an error, but it is good practice to include after each command, or statement--after each single instruction given to the console. You'll see more examples of this (and learn when _not_ to include semicolons) as we progress. For now, just make sure to __include the semicolon__ at the end of each line of code.\r\n\r\n### Using Your Browser's Console\r\n\r\nWhile we have provided a console for you embedded into this web page, you can also use a console built into your browser's developer tools to run commands. Most modern browsers allow you access to a developer console where you can work with JavaScript and read or manipulate data on a page. \r\n\r\nTo open the developer console, you can use these methods:\r\n\r\n__Chrome:__\r\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\r\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\r\n- Open the Chrome settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select `More Tools` \u003e `Developer Tools`\r\n\r\n__Firefox:__\r\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\r\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\r\n\r\n__Safari:__\r\n- Develop menu in Safari’s Advanced preferences\r\n- Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element\r\n- Command + Option + i\r\n\r\n__Opera:__\r\n- Command + Option + i (Mac)\r\n- Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux)\r\n\r\nUsing these shortcuts should open a console window that you can use to run commands. After the `\u003e` prompt, create another new `alert` command and hit the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key to run it. You should again see a pop-up box that displays your message. Practice opening your console with these commands to get the feel of it into your fingers.\r\n\r\nWe should note here that the alert's system dialog box is not related to the design of the webpage currently being shown in the browser. Its appearance depends solely on your current operating system and browser (rather than on the HTML code of the current page). You will learn how to manipulate a webpage's content and appearance directly with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in later lessons.  \r\n\r\n### The console.log() Function\r\n\r\nLet's use another technique to display \"Hello, World!\" This time, we will use the `console.log()` function, which writes a message to be output by the console. In your browser's developer console, write the following line of code:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now see the message \"Hello, World!\" printed out for you in the console itself.\r\n\r\nThe `console.log()` function is a useful tool for testing and debugging your code. As you continue learning JavaScript and begin building your own webpages, you will find it an effective way to display and understand the results of your programs.\r\n\r\n__Note__: If you also receive a message of `undefined` in the console, don't worry! You will understand why this is happening as you continue learning more about how functions work in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nFor now, let's continue working with the JavaScript console by exploring the way the language deals with data and discrete bits of information.\r\n\r\n## Data Types\r\n\r\n__Data types__ form the atomic elements of JavaScript programs and are used to store and manipulate data. The basic data types in JavaScript are: __number__, __string__, __boolean__, __array__, and __object__. For now, let's just discuss the first three of these types and how you can use them.\r\n\r\n### Numbers\r\n\r\nValues of the `number` type are, as you might have guessed, numbers. Try typing the following numbers into the console, hitting the \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e key after each one:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n\u003e 9;\r\n\u003e 3.8;\r\n\u003e -1.2;\r\n```\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nWe can also perform various mathematical calculations on these numbers. For example, try running each of the following mathematical operations in the console:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n\u003e 5 + 5\r\n\u003e 5 - 5\r\n\u003e 5 / 5\r\n\u003e 5 * 5\r\n\u003e 5 % 6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nJavaScript calculates the result of these operations for you. Whenever you can use a number, you can also create a mathematical expression using typical algebraic operators. The last example uses the \u003ckbd\u003e%\u003c/kbd\u003e (remainder) symbol, which evaluates the remainder of a division.\r\n\r\n### Strings\r\n\r\nAs a data type, a __string__ is simply a series of alphanumeric characters, meaning it can combine both numbers and text into a phrase. Strings are mostly used for displaying or recognizing a series of text in your programs. You have actually already encountered a string--in the `console.log(\"Hello, World!\");` command you ran above, everything enclosed in the double-quotation marks (namely, `Hello, World!`) is considered a string.\r\n\r\nJust like with numbers, you can simply type a string (for instance, `\"Hello, World!\"`) into the console and it will repeat your string back to you. It is important to note that were you to add a number to the string, e.g., `\"Hello, World in the Year 3030!\";`, the entire phrase would still be considered a string and _not_ a number. This is because you have enclosed it within double-quotation marks, which always indicates a `string` type.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that you can use both single- \u003ckbd\u003e'\u003c/kbd\u003e and double-quotation \u003ckbd\u003e\"\u003c/kbd\u003e marks to identify a string. It is important, however, to keep your use consistent. For instance, if you were to write `\"Hello, World!'`, beginning the phrase with double-quotes and ending with a single-quote, you will receive a `SyntaxError` (we'll cover how to deal with errors in a bit more detail later). It is best practice to primarily use double-quotes, as this allows you to use single-quotes _within_ a phrase without the console throwing errors. For example, `\"It is Jill's birthday.\"` is a perfectly valid expression, while `'It is Jill's birthday.'` is not.\r\n\r\n__Note__: If you need to use double-quotes inside of a string, there are two ways you can do this. You can, conversely, simply use single-quotation marks to surround a phrase, e.g., `'I wonder what \"truth\" means today?'`, or you can use a \u003ckbd\u003e\\\u003c/kbd\u003e (backslash) to precede a double-quotation mark within enclosed double-quotation marks, e.g. `\"I wonder what \\\"truth\\\" means today?\"`. \r\n\r\nStrings can also utilize the `+` operator to __concatenate__, or join, separate string phrases together. For example, `\"Hello, \" + \"World!\"` will return `\"Hello, World!\"`. Try it out in the console below.\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\n## Comparisons\r\n\r\nIn the table below, you can see more of the various operators available to you as a JS programmer when working with data types. Many of the most useful operators deal in terms of comparison: seeing if one value is equal to, greater than, or lesser than another value. Each of these comparisons will evaluate to either `true` or `false`. It is important to understand how these operators work, so try inputting some of the examples you might be unclear with into the JS console to check out the results for yourself. In the `\"5\" == \"5\"` example below, each 5 is actually considered a _string_, rather than a number, because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\r\n\r\n\u003ctable\u003e\r\n    \u003ccaption\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComparison Operators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/caption\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth\u003eOperator\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003cth\u003eMeaning\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003cth\u003eExample\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003cth\u003eEvaluation\u003c/th\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003c \u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n   \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c 6 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e \u003e \u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e 4 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003c=\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e less than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003c= 4 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e\u003e=\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e greater than or equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 \u003e= 6 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e==\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == 4 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 == \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"3\"\u003e!=\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != 4 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e not equal to? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 != \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e===\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict equal\" to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 === 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003cth rowspan = \"2\"\u003e!==\u003c/th\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== \"5\" \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003etrue\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n    \u003ctr\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e \"strict\" not equal to (includes type)? \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003e 5 !== 5 \u003c/td\u003e\r\n        \u003ctd\u003efalse\u003c/td\u003e\r\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003c/table\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nWhile nearly all of these operators are shared amongst the majority of modern programming languages, the `===` (triple equals) is unique to JavaScript. The distinctions between `==` (double equals) and `===` (triple equals) are important. The double equals `==` operator is used to compare _only_ the value of two variables, while the \"strict\" triple equals `===` operator is used to compare the value _and_ type of two variables. The strict operator will only return true if the two variables are _exactly_ the same, both in value and in type (e.g., number or string). So, while both `5 === 5` and `\"5\" === \"5\"` will return true because they are the same value and type, `5 === \"5\"` will return false because the latter is testing a number against a string. Also note the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`, which test for equality, and the `!=` and `!==` operators, which test for _inequality_.\r\n\r\nWe'll continue to work with comparison/equality operators throughout the course, so don't worry if they're still a bit unclear. Additionally, we have for now purposefully left out the `=` (single equals) operator, as it has a different function than evaluating equality. We'll cover the single equals operator later in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Boolean\r\n\r\nUnlike some real-world scenarios, determining what is true and false in JavaScript is refreshingly straightforward. __Booleans__ are data types that are either firmly `true` or `false`. In utilizing the comparison operators from the table earlier, you have already discovered how the console determines truth and falsity. For instance, typing `9 \u003e 5` evaluates to `true`, whereas `5 \u003e 9` evaluates to `false`. Similarly, `5 \u003e= 5` as well as `5 \u003c= 5` both resolve as `true`. If you simply type `true` or `false` into the console, the console recognizes it as a data type and will repeat it back to you.\r\n\r\nBooleans may seem simple, but very often in programming you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, akin to a \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"on\" or \"off\" determination. We will work more with booleans as we progress through the course.\r\n\r\nAs a final step for this lesson, let's make using data types a bit more interesting by introducing __variables__.\r\n\r\n## Variables\r\n\r\nNow that we have explored a number of data types and how to use them, let's explore how to create variables in JavaScript to utilize data types more effectively.\r\n\r\nYou can think of __variables__ as kinds of containers for data. They are named and can be assigned a value based on whatever data type is appropriate. To create a variable, type the `var` keyword along with the name of the variable you want to create, followed by a single equal sign (`=`) and then the value of the variable. For example, `var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";` will create a new variable called `myMessage` and assign it the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. Creating a variable is called __declaring__ or __defining__ it, and attributing a value to it is called __assigning__ it.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this drastically sets apart the single equals `=` operator from the double equals `==` operator. The single equals operator is used to __assign__ a value to a variable, while the double equals operator (as well as the triple equals) is used to __test__ if two values or variables are equal to each other (without modifying either value).\r\n\r\nIn the example below, we have replicated our `Hello, World!` message, only this time using a variable. You can see that instead of simply logging the string `\"Hello, World!\"` to the console, we have assigned the string to a variable called `myMessage` and then logged the value of `myMessage` to the console.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var myMessage = \"Hello, World!\";\r\n    console.log(myMessage);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and working effectively with variables is probably the most important part of programming. They allow you to store data in memory, and then use that data to perform all kinds of operations upon it. Take a look at the example below:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar a = 1;\r\nvar b = 2;\r\nvar c = a + b;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. In other words, here we are assigning the value of a variable to that of the addition of two other variables. What do you think the result would be if we were to `console.log(c);`? \r\n\r\nNow let's make something ever so slightly more interesting. Let's talk about the weather.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar weather = 'sunny';\r\nvar statement = 'The weather is ' + weather + ' today.';\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier, you saw how we can concatenate strings together to form a compound phrase. You can also use the `+` operator to combine strings and variables. In the above example, the variable `statement`, assigned `\"The weather is \" + weather + \" today.\"` will return the string `\"The weather is sunny today.\"`.\r\n\r\nAny of the data types you have already learned can be assigned to a variable. For example, you can assign a number to a variable, a string to a variable, a boolean to a variable, etc.\r\n\r\nAs your programs become more complex, it is generally good practice to declare all of your variables at the top of your program. This will make it easier to find and understand your code later. Take a look at the program below:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar book, author, isbn, description;\r\n\r\nbook = \"Hunger\";\r\nauthor = \"Knut Hamsun\";\r\nisbn = 0374525285;\r\n\r\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\r\nconsole.log(description);\r\n\r\nbook = \"The Master and Margarita\";\r\nauthor = \"Mikhail Bulgakov\";\r\nisbn = 0679760806;\r\n\r\ndescription = \"The book \" + book + \" by \" + author + \" is on ISBN \" + isbn;\r\nconsole.log(description);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we have declared all the variables we want to include for our categorization of the books at the top of the program.  It is important to note that these variables persist only for the duration of your particular session with the console. If you close the console, they will be deleted from memory. You will also notice, however, that the values of the variables are __mutable__, meaning that they can be changed as the program progresses. If you run this program in the console, each `console.log()` command will display a new description. __Note__: Certain variable types are __immutable__, meaning that they cannot be changed. We'll explore additional details about immutable variables in later lessons.\r\n\r\n### Variable Naming Conventions\r\n\r\nThere are a few rules for variable naming conventions in JavaScript. \r\n\r\n- Variables must begin with a letter or an underscore. You can't begin a variable name with a number (although you can use numbers after). \r\n- Variables must not contain spaces or special characters. For example, `myVariable` is a valid variable name, but `my variable` is not.\r\n- Variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable named `My_Books` is treated as an entirely different variable than one named `my_books`.\r\n- You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language. For a complete list, see here: [Reserved Words](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp).\r\n- Do not include hyphens `-`. Hyphens can be misconstrued by JavaScript as attempts to subtract one value from another and will cause errors.\r\n\r\nIn general, try to keep your variable names as short and descriptive of their purpose as possible.\r\n\r\n## Using typeof\r\n\r\nLet's end our discussion of variables with one more nifty tool: the `typeof` operator. The `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a variable. For example, if you have a variable named `myVariable`, you can use the `typeof` operator to determine what kind of data it is.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myVariable = \"Hello, World!\";\r\nconsole.log(typeof myVariable);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you look at your developer console, you should see a `string` correctly identified as the data type of `myVariable`. You can use this operator to determine the data type of any variable you have created. This can become very useful when you are working with data types that are unknown to you or when you are converting data types from one type to another (which we'll begin learning in the next lesson).\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\nLet's review some of the main concepts we've covered in this lesson and get some practice in.\r\n\r\n1. `console.log()` is best used for (select one):\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- testing and debugging your code*\r\n- changing the appearance of a webpage\r\n- warning the user about something\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2.

In JavaScript, as in algebra, ambiguity in a mathematical expression is resolved by [rules of precedence (PEMDAS)](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/orderops.htm). For example, the expression `5 + 5` is evaluated as `10`, while the expression `5 + 5 * 5` is evaluated as `30`. Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression `5 + 5 * 10 /2` so that it resolves to `50`. Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to `true` using the double equals `==` operator.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar a = 15;\r\nvar b = 10;\r\nvar c = 30;\r\nvar d = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\n2. Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an `alert` to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. __Note__: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using `console.log()` to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms from this lesson?\r\n\r\n- boolean\r\n- string\r\n- variable\r\n- concatenation\r\n- declaration/assignment\r\n- mutability\r\n\r\n# If/Then\r\n\r\nSo far, we have been working with fairly simple programming structures. Our code thus far has been written as a single, linear, ordered list of instructions. However, there are other ways to structure your code that takes account of various conditions and reacts accordingly. \r\n\r\nWe are speaking here about __control flow__: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\r\n\r\nIn general, code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. We will explore several of these structures in this lesson and learn how to use them to create dynamic, branching programs. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson you will learn to build your own small text-based \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game that allows players/readers to change the outcomes of a story based on their decisions. Let's get started! \r\n\r\n## Thinking in Code\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the process of thinking in code. What does someone think about before they write code? In your head, how might you imagine what the code in action would look like? \r\n\r\nIn general, we might present a few initial ideas about the process:\r\n\r\n1. The computer reads from top to bottom. It does things according to the instructions it reads, step by step. That's the sense in which we mean 'scripting'. My thought process is about the steps that are necessary to get from the beginning to a defined end. What kind of data do I have? How will it have to be transformed? What will be the result? That's the linear vision of scripting.\r\n2. Digging into the code is a lot more difficult and we really need to envision its structure. What might the structure of the code look like? What is the structure of the data itself? That's the hierarchical vision of scripting.\r\n3. A branching, rather than linear, vision of code is about the decisions that are made in the process of getting to the end. The branches in the program are equivalent to a \"decision tree.\" \r\n\r\n![Decision Tree](/images/decision-tree.drawio.png)\r\n\r\nThe decision tree is a visual representation of the process of getting to the end of a program. The diagram above shows how code will follow the different \"branches\" depending on the truth or falsity of a certain condition.\r\n\r\nTo aid us in thinking about what our program might look like, let's also consider what a typical \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game would consist of. In simple terms, it would need:\r\n\r\n1. A predefined story (the story that the player is told)\r\n2. A set of choices that the player can make at certain points in the story \r\n3. An internal way to change the story based on the player's choices (code branching)\r\n4. A set of outcomes that the player can see based on their choices \r\n\r\nLet's keep these ideas in mind and use them as a rough roadmap for the rest of the lesson.\r\n\r\nFor now, let's not worry about the details of the story. Let's first start by exploring a simple way to allow the player to make choices and a way to store those choices.\r\n\r\n## Prompts\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest ways to gather user input is through the `prompt()` function. This function displays a message to the user and waits for them to enter a response in the response field. The `prompt()` function returns the user's response as a string. Let's take a look at it in detail.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var userName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\r\n```\r\nHere is a simple example of the `prompt()` function in action. The user is asked to enter their name and waits for them to type it out and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Once the user completes their name, their response will be stored in the variable `userName`. In other words, the function __returns__ the value you enter and stores it in the variable. We'll learn more about returns in a later lesson. For now, try running the code in the console below, answer the prompt, and then type `userName` in the console to see that the variable is now populated with the name you have entered.\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nPretty nifty, right? `Prompt` code is like `alert` code, with a couple differences:\r\n\r\n1. In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. So, you must begin the prompt with a variable declaration.\r\n2. In a prompt, you can specify a second message, which acts as a \"default\" value. If the user doesn't enter a response, the default message will be stored in the variable. For instance, we might make a prompt like: `var whatAmI = prompt(\"What am I?\", \"I am a human!\");`, in which `I am a human!` will show in the response field and act as the default return value if the user doesn't enter anything themselves. \r\n\r\n### parseInt()\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the user's response to a `prompt` is _always_ a string. If you want to store and handle the user's response as a number (so you can perform arithmetic on it), you will need to convert it to a number using the `parseInt()` function. The `parseInt()` function takes a string and returns the number it represents. For example, `parseInt(\"5\")` will return `5` (the number).\r\n\r\nLet's try this out now, this time asking the user their age:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\r\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\r\n    alert(\"You are \" + userAge + \" years old.\");\r\n    typeof userAge;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nFor this example we simply update `userAge` with the new conversion value. As you can see by checking with `typeof`, the user's response is now registered as a number.\r\n\r\n__Note:__ This is not a foolproof data type conversion tactic and is easily broken. For instance, if you type the response \"one\" into the prompt instead of 1, the `parseInt` function will return a `NaN` (Not a Number) value. The `NaN` value is a special value that is returned when you try to perform arithmetic on a value that is not recognized as a number. For our purposes at the moment, however, this technique will suffice.\r\n\r\n## If/Else Statements\r\n\r\nSo far so good--we now have a way to capture user input. However, we don't yet have a way to react or respond to that input. For this we can use a different kind of structure called an __if/else statement__. These statements allow us to make decisions based on the value of a variable.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of an `if/else` statement is:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    if (condition) {\r\n        // code to run if condition is true\r\n    } else {\r\n        // code to run if condition is false\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf statements translate to something like \"_If condition is met, then execute the task_\". In other words, the code in the `if` \"block\" will run if the `condition` (whatever it may be) is true and skip the `else` block, and the code in the `else` block will run if the `condition` is false and skip the initial `if` block. Note the beginning and ending curly braces `{}` surrounding each branch of the code: `if` and `else` always utilize curly braces, rather than semicolons. These braces always indicate a particular block of code and you will encounter them in many contexts.\r\n\r\nAlso note the text following the two forward slashes `//`: these are called __comments__. Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the computer. They are purely for human readers. As we continue to build more complex programs, we will often use comments to explain the code. Writing comments for yourself is an important way to make sure that you recall the purpose of the code you are writing if you return to it later. It also helps others reading your code to understand your intentions as well.\r\n\r\nLet's look at a more concrete example of an if/else statement, modifying our \"get the user's age\" program from above and seeing if they are legally eligible to vote (as far as age goes) in the U.S. Try running the code in the console below.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\r\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\r\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\r\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\r\n    } else {\r\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote in the U.S.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nAfter gathering the user input and performing the conversion, we then use an `if/else` statement to determine if the user is old enough to vote (that is, we check to see if they are 18 years or older). \r\n\r\n## Else If Statements\r\n\r\nUsing `else if`, you can utilize as many statements as you want in your code to check as many conditions as you need. Try running the following example in the console:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript    \r\n    var userAge = prompt(\"How old are you?\");\r\n    userAge = parseInt(userAge);\r\n\r\n    if (userAge \u003e= 18) {\r\n        alert(\"You are legally old enough to vote and drive in the U.S.\");\r\n    } else if (userAge \u003e= 16) {\r\n        alert(\"You are not old enough to vote, but you are old enough to drive in the U.S.\");\r\n    } else {\r\n        alert(\"You are not legally old enough to vote or drive in the U.S.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nThe first `if` statement checks to see if the user is old enough to vote. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the second statement `else if` checks to see if they are at least able to drive. If they are, the `alert` message is displayed. If they are not, the final `else` statement displays the last `alert` message. The final `else` statement in a series is usually considered a default case or catchall to execute if none of the other `if/else` statements are true.\r\n\r\nAlong with testing as many conditions as you want, you can also run as many lines of code as you want in each block. You can even chain together a series of `if/else` statements. This is called __nesting__. For example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nif (condition1){\r\n    // code to run if condition1 is true\r\n    if (condition2){\r\n        // code to run if condition2 is true\r\n        if (condition3){\r\n            // code to run if condition3 is true\r\n        } else {\r\n            // code to run if condition3 is false\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        // code to run if condition2 is false\r\n    }\r\n} else {\r\n    // code to run if condition1 is false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you might be able to tell from just this example, too many nested `if/else` statements can be hard to read and hard to maintain, so try to keep them to a minimum whenever possible.\r\n\r\nTo help you understand how each block of this conditional cascade is structured, take a look at the diagram below:\r\n\r\n![if/else diagram](/images/if-else-diagram.png)\r\n\r\nThe arrows indicate the beginning (opening) and ending (closing) braces of a particular `if/else` statement. By matching the colors of each statement, you can see how the curly braces are continually nesting and designating their own blocks of code. While many modern code editors have their own built-in syntax highlighting (or coloring) as well as automatic indentation and bracing to make our code more visually understandable, it is still important to keep a close eye on your code and make sure you are following the correct structure and working in the correct block. \r\n\r\n## Switch Statements\r\n\r\nSwitch statements are another control flow structure used to handle multiple conditions. They are perhaps not as common, but they are useful to cover here briefly, as they can have a cleaner syntax than creating overly complex chains of `if/else` statements.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of a switch statement is:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    switch (variable) {\r\n        case value1:\r\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value1`\r\n            break;\r\n        case value2:\r\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value2`\r\n            break;\r\n        case value3:\r\n            // code to run if `variable` is `value3`\r\n            break;\r\n        default:\r\n            // code to run if `variable` is not `value1`, `value2`, or `value3`\r\n            break;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the `if/else` statement, the `switch` statement is broken into a series of `case` statements. Each `case` statement is a condition that the `switch` statement will check. The `switch` statement will then execute the code in the block that is associated with the first `case` statement that is evaluated as true. If none of the `case` statements are true, the `default` block will be executed.\r\n\r\nThe `break` statement is used to break out of the `switch` statement. The `break` statement is not required, but it is recommended to use it. If you omit the `break` statement, the `switch` statement will continue to execute the code in the next `case` statements even if they do not match the case.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a more concrete example of a `switch` statement. Let's say we were creating a computer game, and wanted to let the player pick a difficulty setting. Take a look at the following code and run it in the console:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var difficulty = prompt(\"What difficulty would you like to play? 1- Easy, 2- Medium, 3- Hard\");\r\n    switch (difficulty) {\r\n        case \"1\":\r\n            alert(\"You have selected the Easy difficulty.\");\r\n            break;\r\n        case \"2\":\r\n            alert(\"You have selected the Medium difficulty.\");\r\n            break;\r\n        case \"3\":\r\n            alert(\"You have selected the Hard difficulty.\");\r\n            break;\r\n        default:\r\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n            break;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\u003cJSTerminal /\u003e\r\n\r\nHere we have three different difficulty levels (although you can have as many levels or `cases` as you want in a `switch` statement). The first `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `1`, the second `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `2`, and the final `case` statement checks to see if the user entered `3`. If the user entered `1`, `2`, or `3`, the `alert` message is displayed. If the user entered anything else, the `default` block is executed and an error message is shown. \r\n\r\nWhile this example could also easily be written using `if/else` statements, in your programming journey there may be times when writing a `switch` statement is more appropriate than writing many unwieldy `if/else` statements. Did you notice how many fewer curly braces you had to keep track of when writing a `switch` structure? Readability is just as important as functionality in programming.\r\n\r\n## Choose Your Own Adventure\r\n\r\nNow that you have a better understanding of some basic control flow structures in JavaScript, it's time to put them to work creating a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using `prompt` for input and `alert()` for output. Since our game is meant to be a piece of interactive fiction, we'll want to use a variable to track player choices, and perhaps also let the player input their name to personalize the game and get things started.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\r\n\r\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\r\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we can begin adding our story. I am going to show you an example, but feel free to get creative and write a story of your own. For my example, I am going to adapt the first two lines of Fredric Brown’s short story “Knock,” written in 1948. These two lines are a complete story in themselves and are widely considered one of the shortest and yet most evocative horror/sci fi stories to date. In Brown’s story, the first two lines are as follows: \r\n\r\n\u003e “The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on the door.”\r\n\r\nI’m going to have some fun with this story and let the player decide what to do next. I will also modify the language a bit—because we are creating a Choose Your Own Adventure story, we want to use second person phrasing (you). So, my story will look rather like this:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\r\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\r\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\r\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\r\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\r\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's try adding some more options to our story. Using the code editor below, see if you can add further options by nesting additional `if-else if` statements in the areas I have indicated with comments. You'll first want to include a new `prompt()` for `playerChoice` to get the player's new choices.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height = '600px'\u003e\r\nvar playerName, playerChoice;\r\nvar playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\r\nalert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\r\nalert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\r\nplayerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\r\nif (playerChoice == \"1\"){\r\n    alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\r\n    // add new prompt and choices for this branch here\r\n} else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\r\n    alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\r\n    // add new prompt and choices for this branch here\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n}\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you successfully able to add more options? Study my example below for a minute. For each choice (whether 1 or 2), I have added a new `if/else-if/else` statement within that block:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){ // here's their first choice #1\r\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\r\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\r\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){ //here's their second choice #1\r\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\r\n        }\r\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){ //here's their second choice #2\r\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\"); // invalid entry for second choices\r\n        }\r\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){ // here's their first choice #2\r\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\r\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\r\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){ //here's their second choice #1\r\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\r\n        }\r\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){ //here's their second choice #2\r\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\"); // invalid entry for second choices\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\"); // invalid entry for first choices\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, we are creating a branching structure that follows different paths according to player choice.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together then, here is the story so far:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    var playerName, playerChoice;\r\n\r\n    var playerName = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\r\n    alert(\"Welcome, \" + playerName + \"!\");\r\n\r\n    alert(playerName + \", you are the last person on earth, sitting alone in a room. There is a knock on the door... What will you do?\");\r\n    playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to cautiously approach the door. Enter 2 to hide under the table.\");\r\n    if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\r\n        alert(\"Your hands are trembling as you approach the door. You pause a moment before it.\");\r\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to bravely open the door. Enter 2 to look through the door's peephole.\");\r\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\r\n            alert(\"You swing the door open with courageous gusto.\")\r\n        }\r\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\r\n            alert(\"You cautiously look through the peephole. You make out a vague shape looming before the door.\")\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n        }\r\n    } else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\r\n        alert(\"As you hide under the table you hear the doorknob rattling.\");\r\n        playerChoice = prompt(\"Enter 1 to stay hidden under the table. Enter 2 to get up and find a weapon to defend yourself with.\");\r\n        if (playerChoice == \"1\"){\r\n            alert(\"Whatever is at the door has now begun banging on it loudly.\");\r\n        }\r\n        else if (playerChoice == \"2\"){\r\n            alert(\"You quickly but quietly get up and look around. You see a broom in the corner of the room and wield it mightily.\");\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        alert(\"Invalid entry.\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy/paste my code into the code editor below if you'd like to see it in action.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height = '450px'\u003e\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nWhile this approach to creating a Choose Your Own Adventure program works, it is very clunky and quite hard to read. As we said before, simply using a bunch of nested `if/else if` statements makes a program incredibly difficult to build and maintain. You probably noticed this yourself when trying to add more choices to the program. Also, if the player incorrectly inputs a number, this program simply exits rather than prompting them to try again. Thankfully, JavaScript has many tools to help us address these issues. As we continue to learn more about the language, we will learn to use more control flow structures and data types to make our programs more readable and maintainable. Specifically, in the next lesson we will begin learning about loops and how to use them to repeat blocks of code, iterate over a series of values, and make our programs more efficient overall.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\r\n\r\n1.

We will also learn to work with a very versatile new data type called `arrays`. To put these skills to work, at the end of the lesson we will create a simple library app that allows users to search for a book and see if it is located in the library's collection. \r\n\r\n## Arrays\r\n\r\nLet's begin by learning about the `array` data type. So far, you have encountered variables that only contain a single value. An array, in contrast, is a _series_ or a _collection_ of values stored in a single variable. The following is an example of four different arrays:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\nvar myArray2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];\r\nvar myArray3 = [true, false, true, false];\r\nvar myArray4 = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating an array is just like other variable declarations you have seen, but the items it contains are always denoted by square brackets `[]`. An array can house any of the data types we have encountered so far. The first array, for example, contains a series of numbers, the second array contains a series of letters, and the third array contains a series of booleans. Arrays are very versatile and can also contain a mix of different data types, like in the fourth example. As you can see, this array even contains another array `[1, 2, 3]`!\r\n\r\nArrays are useful when you want to have a series of values that are easily accessible. Creating an individual variable for each of the values in the example above, for instance, would make your code very confusing and hard to work with.\r\n\r\nLet's look at how we can access the values in an array.\r\n\r\n## Accessing Values in an Array\r\n\r\nTo work with particular values in an array, we access its __index__. Values in an array are numbered starting from 0. The first value in an array is at index 0, the second value at index 1, and so on. Take a look at the example below:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe access the index of an array by using the square brackets `[]` and the corresponding index number. The code snippet above will `alert` the value at index 0 of the array `myArray`. Remember, 0 is the _first_ value in an array, 1 is the _second_ value, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry using `alert` to display the value for each of the items from the example in the code editor below:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, when you access the value at index 4 (`myArray[4]`), you get the value `1, 2, 3`. Again, this is because the value at index 4 is an array itself.\r\n\r\n## Changing Values in an Array\r\n\r\nTo change the value at a particular index in an array, we use the same syntax. We use the square brackets `[]` and the index number to access the value, and then assign that index a new value.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray[0] = 'cat';\r\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'cat'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the value at index 0 (originally `1`) will be changed to `'cat'`.\r\n\r\n## Adding Values to an Array\r\n\r\nTo add a new value to the end of an array, we use the `push()` method. __Methods__ are utilized with _dot notation_, and act upon whatever object or value (in the case below, an array) you specify. The `push()` method takes a single value and adds it to the end of the array.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray.push('cat');\r\nalert(myArray[5]); // returns 'cat'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we attach our `push()` method to `myArray` with a `.` (dot), and indicate the value we want to add in the `()` parentheses. This code adds the value `'cat'` to the end of the array `myArray`. Methods are similar to functions, but are used to act upon a specific object. We will learn more about functions in the next lesson, but for now, just keep in mind the general syntax and usage of methods.\r\n\r\n## Removing Values from an Array\r\n\r\nTo remove a value from an array, we can use the `pop()` method. This method removes the last value in the array.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray.pop();\r\nalert(myArray[4]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nOh no, we are now getting a message of `undefined`! But this is exactly what we intended to happen, because the `pop()` method removed the last value in the array. So, when we try to access it, JavaScript finds nothing there.\r\n\r\n## Splicing an Array\r\n\r\nIf we want to remove a range of values from an array or start at a particular index, we can use the `splice()` method. This method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the index number of the first value we want to start from and remove, and the second parameter is the number of values to remove in total.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\r\nalert(myArray[0]); // returns 'dog'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the first two values in the array `myArray` are removed (we start at index 0 and remove two values total). After the operation, the value at index 0 is now `'dog'`.\r\n\r\n## Determining the Length of an Array\r\n\r\nIt may not always be clear to you how many values are actually stored in a particular array at any given time, especially if it becomes very large or you are adding and removing a lot of elements. To determine the number of values in an array, we use the `length` property. The `length` property returns the number of values in an array. For example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nalert(myArray.length); // returns 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe utilize `length` by prefacing it with a `.` (dot) and the array we want to act upon. Note that with `length`, you don't need to include the ending parentheses. This is because, strictly speaking, length is a property (a value), and not a method (which act like functions). Don't worry too much about this difference for now, just keep in mind that `length` does not require parentheses.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `length` counts through the values in the array, so it will return 5. It is important to note here that `length` starts with 1, not 0, so although the last value in the array is at index 4, `length` will still return 5. Confusing, right? It is simply a quirk of the language to get used to, so keep it in mind when working with arrays.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if you want to access the last value in the array, you can use the `[length - 1]` syntax. This will always return the last value in the array:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nalert(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // returns [1, 2, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a useful way to access the last value in an array even when you don't know how many elements the array holds.\r\n\r\n## The sort() Method\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at one last method that we can use on arrays. The `sort()` method sorts an array in alphabetical order, and is particularly useful if you have an array of letters or strings:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd'];\r\nmyArray.sort();\r\nalert(myArray); // returns ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can, however, also use the `sort()` method to sort an array in numerical order. For example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5];\r\nmyArray.sort();\r\nalert(myArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are [many other methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp) you can perform on arrays, and we have only scratched the surface here. But keep in mind that arrays are a powerful tool for storing and manipulating data. Let's now take a look at how we can loop through arrays to make our code more efficient.\r\n\r\n## Looping Through an Array\r\n\r\nWe have so far seen how we can access values in an array, and manipulate them in ways that are useful. But what if we want to do something with every value in an array? For instance, if we wanted to access every value in an array, it would be very tedious to write out the same code over and over, referencing each and every item:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nmyArray[0];\r\nmyArray[1];\r\nmyArray[2];\r\nmyArray[3];\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThankfully, we can do this in a more efficient way. Let's explore a new kind of technique called __looping__. Looping is a way to iterate through a structure and perform an action on each element.\r\n\r\n## The For Loop\r\n\r\nWhen you want to loop through an array, the most common way is with a `for` loop. This loop will __iterate__ or step through the array and execute a block of code for each value in the array.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of a `for` loop is as follows:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c array.length; i++) {\r\n    // do something\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may look a little complicated, so let's explore it a bit. The `for` loop is comprised of three parts: the first part is the initialization of the loop, which is the variable `i` in this case (`i` is often used by convention, but the variable name can be anything you want). The second part is the condition that the loop will continue to execute until, and the third part is the incrementor. Each is separated by a semi-colon `;`.\r\n\r\nTo break it down a little more:\r\n- `var i = 0`: This is the starting point of the loop. It will serve as the index number of the first element in the array.\r\n- `i \u003c array.length`: This is the condition of the loop. It is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue. In other words, it says: \"while `i` is less than the `length` of the array, do the following:\".\r\n- `i++`: This is the incrementor. `++` is a new operator that means that the value of `i` will increase or __increment__ by 1 each time the loop executes. We use it to increment the index number of the loop so that it will continually move to the next element in the array. \r\n\r\n Let's see how this works in action using our `myArray` array from earlier:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nfor (var i = 0; i \u003c myArray.length; i++) {\r\n    alert(myArray[i]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry running this code in the code editor below.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the loop iterated through the array and alerted each value in the array. You'll notice that the loop executed the alert 5 times instead of displaying all the values at once. This is because the loop is executing the alert once _for each_ value in the array. In other words, the code inside the `for` loop block executes once for each value in the array based on the current value of `i`. So, if there are 5 values in the array, the loop will execute 5 times.\r\n\r\n`for` loops are incredibly important to get the hang of, so let's look at one more example, looping from 1 to 5:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar num = 5;\r\n\r\n// looping from i = 1 to 5\r\n// in each iteration, i is increased by 1\r\nfor (var i = 1; i \u003c= num; i++) {\r\n    console.log(i);     // printing the value of i\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to run this, what would we get? Well, in this case we would get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we started our loop at `i = 1`, rather than `i = 0`. This is because we want to start our loop at 1, not 0. We then check if `i` is less than or equal to `num`, which is 5. If `i` is less than or equal to 5, the loop will continue to execute. If `i` is greater than 5, the loop will stop executing. Thus, we get the output of 1 through 5.\r\n\r\n## The While Loop\r\n\r\nThe `while` loop is similar to the `for` loop, but it will infinitely execute the code inside a loop until a certain specified condition is met. This is useful if you want a certain code block to run until a particular outcome is resolved. Try running the example in the code editor below: \r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar i = 0;\r\nwhile (i \u003c 5) {\r\n    alert(i);\r\n    i++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the loop executed the alert 5 times, incrementing the value of `i` each time. In other words, this loop is saying: \"while `i` is less than 5, do the following:\".\r\n\r\n__Note:__ It is very important to make sure your `while` loops ultimately end by satisfying the condition you specify. If you don't, the loop will continue forever, and the user will be required to force-quit your program or close the window to stop it.\r\n\r\n## Putting It All Together - The Library App\r\n\r\nLet's use the skills we've learned in this lesson to create a simple app that will allow us to sort, display, and search for book titles from our library.\r\n\r\nTo begin, let's imagine a number of fiction titles that are available in our library and add them to an array. We'll sort this array to put it in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar bookTitles = [\r\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\r\n    'Things Fall Apart',\r\n    'The Master and Margarita',\r\n    'The Three Body Problem',\r\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\r\n    'Beloved',\r\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\r\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\r\n];\r\n\r\nbookTitles.sort();\r\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\r\nvar libRequests = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause we want to get book requests from the user, an empty string `requestedTitle` will store the title of the book that the user requested in the prompt, and an empty array `libRequests` will store all the many requests the user may enter.\r\n\r\nNext, let's give the user a short welcome message. We will also let them know they can make a request by typing `request` at the prompt, display all book titles by typing `display`, or quit the program by typing `quit`:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur welcome message gives the user a few options for what they can do. To keep the text display neat, we use `\\n` characters (specifically 2 in this case) to create two new lines after each statement.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we can envision a few things about how our program should operate:\r\n- We want to allow the user to search for books until they decide to quit. So, a `while` loop will be needed.\r\n- We want to check if the user types `request` or `display` at the prompt. If they do, we want to perform the appropriate action. So, we will need several `if/else` statements. \r\n- We want to iterate through the array of book titles and display each one. So, we can use a `for` loop to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nOkay, conceptually we have the basic toolkit. However, we are missing one crucial piece. We want the program to check if a book title the user enters is actually in the library. That is, we want to see if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`. How can we do this? Let's introduce one more new method: `indexOf`.\r\n\r\n### indexOf\r\n\r\n`indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array. If the value is not found, it will return `-1`. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'fish'];\r\nmyArray.indexOf('dog'); // returns 0\r\nmyArray.indexOf('cat'); // returns 1\r\nmyArray.indexOf('bird'); // returns 2\r\nmyArray.indexOf('fish'); // returns 3\r\nmyArray.indexOf('cow'); // returns -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this method, we can check if a book title the user enters is in the library (if the string the user enters matches an item in the array `bookTitles`). If it doesn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book they requested is not in the library.\r\n\r\nWith this method we should now have everything we need. Let's put the whole program together:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar bookTitles = [\r\n    'Too Loud a Solitude',\r\n    'Things Fall Apart',\r\n    'The Master and Margarita',\r\n    'The Three Body Problem',\r\n    'The Woman Destroyed',\r\n    'Beloved',\r\n    'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall',\r\n    \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\",\r\n];\r\n\r\nbookTitles.sort();\r\nvar libRequests = [];\r\nvar requestedTitle = \"\";\r\n\r\nalert(\"Welcome to the library!\\n\\nPlease search for a book title when prompted.\\n\\nType `request` at the prompt to make a request for a book.\\n\\nYou can also type `display` at the prompt to display all available book titles.\\n\\nType `quit` at the prompt to quit the program.\");\r\n\r\nvar response = \"\";\r\nwhile (response != 'quit') {\r\n    response = prompt(\"Search for a book title or make a request by typing 'request': \");\r\n    // check if the user wants to make a request\r\n    if (response == 'request') {\r\n        requestedTitle = prompt(\"What book would you like to request? \");\r\n        libRequests.push(requestedTitle); // add the requested title to the library requests array\r\n        alert(\"You have requested the following titles:\" + libRequests + \".\"); // alert the user their requests\r\n    }\r\n    // check if the user wants to display all the titles\r\n    else if (response == 'display') {\r\n        for (var i = 0; i \u003c bookTitles.length; i++) {\r\n            alert(bookTitles[i]); // display all available book titles\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n    // otherwise, check if the book the user entered is in the library\r\n    else {\r\n        var bookIndex = bookTitles.indexOf(response);\r\n        if (response != 'quit'){\r\n            // if indexOf returns -1, the book the user entered is not in the library\r\n            if (bookIndex == -1) {\r\n                alert(\"Sorry, we don't have that book. You can always request it.\");\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                alert(\"Yes, \" + response + \" is available to check out.\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry running and exploring the program:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height='550px'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nLet's break down the logic of the program a bit. First, we have a `var response = \"\";` line. This is an empty string variable declaration meant to store the user's response to the prompt. We will use this variable to determine whether or not the user wants to make a request, display, quit, or else search for the book in our library. Next, we have a `while` loop that will continue to execute until the user types `quit`. Within the `while` loop, we first check if the user's response is `request` or `display`. If it is, we can perform the appropriate action using `if/else if` statements. To display all book titles, we use a `for` loop to alert each book. If the response is not a defined user action (i.e., request, display, quit), we can check if the string is in the library. We use the `indexOf` method to check if the `response` string is in the library. If it is, we can alert the user that the book is available to check out. If it isn't (if the method returns `-1`), we can alert the user that the book is not in the library.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have now successfully created a basic library search program. There are, of course, a number of limitations to this program. For instance: \r\n- The search parameters are not very robust. The user must type out the full title of the book, with the exact spelling and punctuation of the title. As you might imagine, this is not a very good user experience.\r\n- The `for` loop sends an alert for each book in the library. This is not ideal, especially if we had a large amount of books. We would want to display the books in a more organized manner.\r\n\r\nThese are basic considerations we would want to take into account if we were actually designing a library search program. However, if you can understand how this program works, you are well on your way to creating complex and robust JavaScript programs. To get some more practice in, try out the challenges below.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\r\n\r\n1. What will be the result of the `alert` in the code below?\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray.pop();\r\nalert(myArray[4]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- 1, 2, 3\r\n- true\r\n- undefined*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. What will be the result of the `alert` in this code snippet?\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nalert(myArray.length);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- 4\r\n- 5*\r\n- 6\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n3. What will be the result of the `alert` here?\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 'dog', true, [1, 2, 3]];\r\nmyArray.splice(0, 2);\r\nalert(myArray[0]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- 1\r\n- 2\r\n- dog*\r\n- true\r\n- [1, 2, 3]\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Write a `for` loop that prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 to the console.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n2. The library program is very case sensitive, requiring the user to enter exact punctuation and capitalization of a book title. This is not a very robust search. Try improving the program using the [toLowerCase method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolowercase.asp), which converts all the letters of a string to lowercase, to make the search parameters case insensitive. _Hint: To match the two terms, you will want to perform the `toLowerCase` method both on the user's response as well as on each book title in the library. Try storing these results in new variables!_\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the following terms from this lesson?\r\n- `array`\r\n- `index`\r\n- `length`\r\n- `push`\r\n- `pop`\r\n- `splice`\r\n- `sort`\r\n- `indexOf`\r\n\r\n# Functions\r\n\r\nIn the last lesson, we learned how to loop through a series of statements to repeat blocks of code. As you saw, this can be very useful if we want to automate a series of tasks that would otherwise take forever to write out manually. __Functions__ are another technique that can be used to repeat and reuse blocks of code and help us automate tasks. In this lesson, we will learn how to create our own functions and how to use them. To this end, at the bottom of the lesson we will create a simple grading program that will allow you to add, calculate, and display student grades.\r\n\r\n## What are Functions?\r\n\r\nFunctions are blocks of code that are designed to perform a specific task and can be reused. When developing applications, you will likely need to perform the same action in many different places. For example, you may need to perform a specific calculation on a number of different values and in different places in your code. Or, you might want to show an error message whenever an error occurs. Instead of rewriting the same code over and over again to perform these actions, you can wrap the code in a function and then call the function whenever you need to perform the action.\r\n\r\nThe basic syntax for creating a function is as follows:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {\r\n    // code to be executed\r\n    return value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a function, you must first define the function name. Naming conventions for functions are [lower CamelCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase), in which the first word is lowercase and the following words begin with a capital letter. Next, you define the function's __parameters__ or __arguments__ within closed parentheses `()`. The parameters are the values that will be __passed__ into the function when it is called. Passing in parameters allows us to reuse the same function for different tasks, because we can pass in different values to the function each time we want to reuse it. The parameters are separated by commas. You can define as many parameters as you want.\r\n\r\nLike loops, you can see that functions use curly braces to define their contents. The contents of the function are the code that will be executed whenever the function is called.\r\n\r\nFor a procedure to be designated a function, it will also __return__ a value. In other words, a function takes some input, transforms that input somehow, and returns an output. \r\n\r\nTo make this all clearer, let's look at a basic example of a function. We will create a function called `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\r\n    return num1 + num2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFirst we define the function `add()` with two parameters to pass in, `num1` and `num2`. To add the two numbers we can simply return `num1 + num2`. Note that we could also have defined a variable `sum` and then returned `sum`, like so:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\r\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\r\n    return sum;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is functionally the same result. The only difference is that we have created a new variable within the function to store the sum.\r\n\r\n## Calling a Function\r\n\r\nIf you were to run the code above, you would see that nothing happens. This is because we have not __called__ the function yet. To call a function, we simply use the function name followed by parentheses. The parentheses contain the values that will be passed into the function as parameters. Let's try calling the `add()` function with two number values:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\r\n    return num1 + num2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd(1, 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry running this code in the editor below.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the result of the `add()` function above returns 3 to the console. This is because `add()` takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. In this case, `num1` is 1 and `num2` is 2. If you change the values of `num1` and `num2` to different numbers, the result will also change. Again, this allows us to reuse the `add()` function to perform the same calculation on different values.\r\n\r\nWe could also capture the result of the function in a variable and then work with that variable. For example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\r\n    var sum = num1 + num2;\r\n    return sum;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar result = add(1, 2);\r\nalert(result);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are calling the `add` function and storing the result of the function (the return value) in the variable `result`. We can then use the variable to perform whatever action we want.\r\n\r\n__Note:__ Make sure you are passing in the correct number of parameters when calling a function (at least for functions you have created yourself. Built-in functions inherent to JavaScript can behave a little differently, but don't worry about that right now). If you call the function with too few parameters or too many parameters, your function will likely either behave in unexpected ways or throw an error.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that you can also call a function with no parameters and also without an explicit `return` statement. For example, we can create a function called `alertHello` that will simply alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction alertHello() {\r\n    alert('Hello!');\r\n}\r\n\r\nalertHello();\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this code will alert \"Hello!\" to the user.\r\n\r\nNote that if your code does not have a return statement or if the content does not return a value, JavaScript functions will automatically return `undefined`.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction doNothing() {\r\n    // do nothing\r\n}\r\n\r\ndoNothing();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you type this code into the developer console in your browser, you will see that the function returns `undefined` because you have not provided it with any return value.\r\n\r\nOkay, now that we have some basic understanding of how functions operate, let's look at how they create new \"scopes\" in your code.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nWhen you create a function, it designates a new __scope__. Scope is the context in which a particular variable is accessible. In other words, it means where a variable can be available for use (read, manipulated, displayed, etc.) in your code. Depending on how and where you declare your variables, you can have different scopes.\r\n\r\n### Rethinking Variable Declarations: `var` vs. `let` and `const`\r\n\r\nSo far in this course, we have used the `var` keyword to declare variables. While this was the old standard way of declaring variables in JavaScript, in most modern usages it has been replaced by the `let` and `const` keywords. `const` in particular has become the new standard for declaring variables in JavaScript. While you can see that the syntax is the same...\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar name = 'John';\r\nlet age = 30;\r\nconst isAdmin = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...the behavior of the keywords is different. From now on, __we will shift to using the `let` and `const` keywords in this course, and in particular, to using `const`.__ What, then, are the differences between these variable declarations?\r\n\r\nTo understand the differences between these declarations, we need to understand their scope. Let's understand the scope of each of these types and see why `let` and especially `const` are the new standard.\r\n\r\n## `var`\r\n\r\n`var` declarations can be \"globally\" and \"function/locally\" scoped. Global scope means that the variable is available for use anywhere throughout your code. Function scope means that the variable is available for use only within the function it is defined. When declared outside of a function, `var` is global and can be accessed anywhere in your code. When declared inside of a function, `var` is function-scoped and can only be accessed within the function. Take a look at the example below:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\r\n\r\nfunction newFunction() {\r\n    var hello = \"hello\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `greet` is globally scoped because it exists outside of the function, while `hello` is function scoped. These variables have different levels of access. To see what I mean, try running the code below in the editor:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar greet = \"hey hi\"\r\n\r\nfunction newFunction() {\r\n    var hello = \"hello\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nconsole.log(greet); // this would work\r\nconsole.log(hello); // but this will not\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the console trips up at the `console.log(hello);` and throws a `ReferenceError`, which states that '`hello is not defined`. This is because `hello` is only available _inside_ of the function in which it was declared. If you try to access `hello` outside of the function, JavaScript can't find the variable declaration you are referring to. In contrast, `greet` will correctly log the value of `greet` because it is globally scoped.\r\n    \r\nYou have also seen how `var` declarations are mutable, insofar as they can be re-declared and reassigned. You can change the value of a `var` at any time:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// re-declaration\r\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\r\nvar greet = \"hello there\";\r\n\r\n// reassignment\r\nvar greet = \"hi there\";\r\ngreet = \"hello there\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this can be useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended. Once your programs become more complex, you may find yourself accidentally re-declaring or reassigning variables without realizing it. This can cause unexpected behavior and can be a source of bugs. This is a large part of why we will use the `let` and `const` keywords in the future instead of `var`, so let's discuss each of those keywords next.\r\n\r\n## `let`\r\n\r\nIn contrast to `var`, `let` declarations are block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. As you have seen, a block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. So, a variable declared inside of a block with `let` is only available within that block. Try running the code below in the editor:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet someValue = 1;\r\n\r\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\r\n    let greet = \"hi there\";\r\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hi there\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someValue); // this will successfully log 1\r\nconsole.log(greet); // but this throws a ReferenceError\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript'\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nWe can see that using `greet` outside of its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. Again, this is because `greet` is only available inside of the block in which it was declared. By contrast, `someValue` is available to display because it was declared within its own block outside of the function.\r\n\r\nJust like with `var`, you can reassign the values of `let` variables at any time. However, unlike `var`, you cannot re-declare a `let` variable. So while this will work:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// reassignment\r\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\r\ngreet = \"hello there\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will not:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// re-declaration, will error\r\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\r\nlet greet = \"hello there\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you try running the re-declaration code you will get a `SyntaxError` that says `\"Identifier 'greet' has already been declared\"`. Using `let` therefore solves the problem of accidentally re-declaring variables. \r\n\r\n__Note:__ While you cannot re-declare a `let` variable within the block is which it was declared, you _can_ re-declare a `let` variable _outside_ of the block in which it was declared:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet greet = \"hi there\";\r\nif (true) {\r\n    let greet = \"hello there\";\r\n    console.log(greet); // this will successfully log \"hello there\"\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(greet); // will successfully log \"hi there\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you understand why this works? Because they are block-scoped, both `greet` variables are treated as _entirely different_ variables!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `let` is an improvement over `var` in the sense that it can help you avoid accidentally modifying the value of a variable that you did not intend to modify. However, `const` has become the standard for many cases, so let's look at why.\r\n\r\n## `const`\r\n\r\nIn the rest of this course, we will often use `const` to declare variables. Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped. This means that the variable is only available within the block of code in which it is declared. However, unlike `let`, `const` variables are __immutable__. This means that once they are declared, they cannot be updated or re-declared. As you might have guessed, `const` is shorthand for \"constant.\" In other words, `const` is a way to declare variables that you will never want to modify.\r\n\r\nThe value of a `const` variable always remains the same within its scope. So, if we declare a `const` variable, we can't do any of the following:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// reassignment\r\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\r\ngreet = \"wait, say hello there instead\"; // throws a TypeError\r\n\r\n// re-declaration\r\nconst greet = \"hi there\";\r\nconst greet = \"I really wish I could say hello there\"; // throws a TypeError\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this code would give you a `TypeError` saying `\"Cannot assign to constant variable\"`. This is because we are trying to change the value of a constant variable.\r\n\r\nOkay, now that we have a basic understanding of how scope in JavaScript works, let's move on to utilizing functions to create a simple grading program.\r\n\r\n## The Student Grades Program\r\n\r\nUsing functions, let's create a simple program that will allow us to evaluate student grades.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine that students have just submitted several homework assignments and we need to evaluate their grades. We want to:\r\n1. Easily display their grades.\r\n2. A new student has joined and submitted work, so we want to add a student to our list of students.\r\n3. Evaluate their numbered grades to a letter (A, B, C, D, or F).\r\n\r\nFunctions are perfect for this because we can define each of these three tasks as a separate function. We can then call each of these functions at the appropriate time. Remember, functions should be used to perform a _single_ defined task whenever possible.\r\n\r\n## Objects\r\n\r\nFor this program, we first need a way to store the information about each student. We want to store the name of each student as well as their corresponding grades. While we could solely use arrays to accomplish this, it makes much more sense to utilize a new data type called __objects__. \r\n\r\nObjects are similar to arrays, but they are more flexible. Objects are collections of _key-value_ pairs, and each key-value pair is called a _property_. In real life, all objects have properties. For example, a car has properties such as `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and so on. Analogously, we might imagine that a student has properties such as `name`, `grade`, `GPA`, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo create an object, we use the curly brace `{}` syntax. For example, we could create a student object with the following code:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet student = {\r\n    name: \"Bob\",\r\n    grade: \"A\",\r\n    GPA: 4.0\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have a student object with three properties: `name`, `grade`, and `GPA`. Each key is followed by a colon `:` and the corresponding value. We separate each key-value pair (each property) with commas.\r\n\r\nTo access the value of a property, we use the `.` syntax with the key. For example, to log the properties of our `student` object, we could write:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconsole.log(student.name); // logs \"Bob\"\r\nconsole.log(student.grade); // logs \"A\"\r\nconsole.log(student.GPA); // logs 4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, objects very usefully allow us to associate a number of different properties with a single item.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we have many students rather than just one. How might we accomplish this? Well, we can create an array of objects! Let's try creating an array of student objects.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet students = [\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Bob\",\r\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Alice\",\r\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Juan\",\r\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have an array of three student objects. Each student object has a `name` property and a `grades` property. The `grades` property is itself an array of numbers (5 different grades).\r\n\r\n### Printing the Grades\r\n\r\nNext, let's write a function to print all student names and their grades. Because we want to iterate through the array of student objects, we will use a `for` loop.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// print all student names and their grades\r\nfunction printGrades(students) {\r\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\r\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprintGrades(students);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we are accessing the `name` and `grades` properties of each student object (using the `.` dot operator) and logging them as we loop through. By using `i` as our index, we are accessing each student object in the array.\r\n\r\n### Adding a Student\r\n\r\nA new student joined our class and submitted his work. So, let's add him to our array of students with a new `addStudent()` function.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\r\n    let student = {\r\n        name: name,\r\n        grades: grades\r\n    };\r\n    students.push(student);\r\n}\r\n\r\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the function, we are creating a new student object with `name` and `grades` properties to match the other students. We then add this object to the end of the `students` array using the `push` method. Finally, we call the function with the name and grades of the new student (poor Biff didn't do too well, sadly), which will add the values to the corresponding properties. If you were to run the `printGrades()` function now, you would see that the new student is included in the list of students.\r\n\r\n### Converting Grades to Letters\r\n\r\nLastly, let's create a function to convert all student grades to letter grades and print them: \r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\r\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\r\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\r\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\r\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\r\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\r\n            } else {\r\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconvertGrades(students);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function is slightly more complicated, because we need to iterate _both_ through the `students` array and each student's `grades` array, and evaluate the latter numbers to a letter grade. We can accomplish this by using two `for` loops: a `for` loop to iterate through the `students` array (using `i` and `students.length`), and a nested `for` loop to iterate through each student's `grades` (using `j` and `grades.length`). As we work through each student object, we first store the grades values of each student in a variable `grades`. Because `grades` is itself an array of values, we can use the `.length` property to determine the number of grades for each student (5). We then use the `if` statement to determine the letter grade for each number, and add it to the `letterGrade` variable with the `+=` operator (with an extra space at the end to make it more readable).\r\n\r\nLet's put the whole program together:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// array of student objects\r\nlet students = [\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Bob\",\r\n        grades: [88, 90, 80, 77, 89]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Alice\",\r\n        grades: [100, 95, 92, 89, 97]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"Juan\",\r\n        grades: [91, 90, 94, 86, 90]\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n\r\n// print all student names and their grades\r\nfunction printGrades(students) {\r\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\r\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + students[i].grades);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n//add a new student\r\nfunction addStudent(name, grades) {\r\n    let student = {\r\n        name: name,\r\n        grades: grades\r\n    };\r\n    students.push(student);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// convert grades to letters\r\nfunction convertGrades(students) {\r\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003c students.length; i++) {\r\n        let grades = students[i].grades;\r\n        let letterGrade = \"\";\r\n        for (let j = 0; j \u003c grades.length; j++) {\r\n            if (grades[j] \u003e= 90) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"A \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 80) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"B \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 70) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"C \";\r\n            } else if (grades[j] \u003e= 60) {\r\n                letterGrade += \"D \";\r\n            } else {\r\n                letterGrade += \"F \";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        console.log(students[i].name + \": \" + letterGrade);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// call functions\r\naddStudent(\"Biff\", [71, 80, 56, 65, 60]);\r\nprintGrades(students);\r\nconvertGrades(students);\r\n```\r\nTry running the program below in the editor. You can observe the results of the program by checking your browser's developer console.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language='JavaScript' height='600px'\u003e\r\n     \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n*Congratulations*, you have now created a simple grading program utilizing functions!\r\n\r\nFunctions are a great way to keep your code organized and readable. They are mainly used to create reusable pieces of code that can be employed in multiple places in your program. Remember that functions should ideally always be used to perform a _single_ task, and that their names should be descriptive of the task they are performing.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\nLet's review the concepts we have learned in this lesson.\r\n\r\n1.

Especially when you are first beginning, it is easy to create errors and to write code that acts erratically or doesn't work at all. In fact, we have already made a few mistakes in previous lessons to illustrate the problems that can arise when learning to work with a new programming language. However, you should be aware that even the most seasoned professional programmers make mistakes as well. Coding can be a frustrating, laborious task at times, and dealing with errors and bugs is a constant process. However, I think you'll also find that coming up with creative ways to address issues that arise in your code can also be a great source of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThankfully, programmers have developed many tools and strategies to help us deal with errors. In this lesson, we will cover a variety of tools, techniques, and strategies to help you write cleaner code, avoid common programming errors and pitfalls, and generally feel more confident in your ability to address problems.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's jump into some common error types and their causes.\r\n\r\n## Common Types of Errors\r\n\r\n### Syntax Errors\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that JavaScript is a finnicky language. One errant `{` can cause your entire program to break. For all their usefulness, computers are not (yet) very good at discerning meaning or understanding implicit intentions. You must speak to them in a highly specific way for them to understand what you are trying to achieve. \r\n\r\nWhen writing JavaScript, the most common type of error to make is a __syntax error__. These errors arise when you fail to add or misspell an element of the language that is needed for the code to be understood. For instance, below is an example of a basic syntax error. Can you identify the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst oops = 12;\r\nif (oops == 12 {\r\n    alert(oops)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we get the message of `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'`. In other words, it is telling us that the first curly brace seems out of place. Why? Well, looking closely you'll notice that we did not close the parentheses `)` in the `if` statement, as JavaScript expected us to. Instead, it found a curly brace and didn't know what to do with it. \r\n\r\nWhen dealing with syntax errors, it is often best to use the error message JavaScript gives you to try and pinpoint where the error might be located. In this example, for instance, the curly brace _is_ where it should be, but is still described as \"unexpected.\" From this you can guess that you are likely missing something immediately before it.\r\n\r\nMany code editors nowadays (including VSCode, which we'll begin to work with in the next lesson) have built-in tools that will detect and alert you to syntactical mistakes you are making while writing your code. Syntax errors will inevitably happen, though, so when you see them arise make sure to take a careful look over what you've written for typos or missing elements.\r\n\r\n### Type Errors\r\n\r\n__Type errors__ are when you try to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For instance, below is an example of a type error. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet num = 1;\r\nlet oops = num.toUpperCase();\r\nconsole.log(oops);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nIn this example, we are trying to use the `toUpperCase` method on a number. However, `toUpperCase` is only available for strings. You can only uppercase text! Hence the `TypeError` message. \r\n\r\nThis error gives us a direct clue for how to fix our code. We would first need to convert the number to a string. For instance, we could use the `toString` method:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript \r\nlet num = 1;\r\nlet fixed = num.toString().toUpperCase();\r\nconsole.log(fixed);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we apply both the `toString` and `toUpperCase` methods to the number, which then allows us to use it as an uppercase string. Note that you can chain methods together to accomplish tasks like this.\r\n\r\nIf, for whatever reason, you are ever in doubt about the particular type of a value, remember that you can use the `typeof` operator to check its type. This is a useful tool for figuring out where you might be going wrong.\r\n\r\n### Reference Errors\r\n\r\nWhen your programs begin to get more complex, it is occasionally difficult to discern what particular scope you are working within. This can cause programs to throw a __Reference Error__. Take a look at the example below. Can you identify what is causing the error? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet someValue = 1;\r\n\r\nif (someValue \u003e 0) {\r\n    let oops = \"blah blah\";\r\n    console.log(oops);\r\n}\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someValue);\r\nconsole.log(oops); \r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we receive the message of `ReferenceError: oops is not defined`. This is telling us that we are trying to use the `oops` variable out of the scope in which it was declared. Always be sure to check the scope of your variables before using them.\r\n\r\n## Logical Errors\r\n\r\n__Logical errors__ occur where your syntax is actually correct but the code is not producing what you intended. In other words, the program runs successfully, but gives \"incorrect\" results. These are often harder to fix than other types of errors, as there usually isn't an explicit error message to direct you to the source of the error.\r\n\r\nTake a look at this example. It is a perfectly valid and legal code snippet, but won't work as intended. Can you identify where it is going wrong? Try running it in the code editor to see the result.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction getPassword(){\r\n  let correct = \"password\";\r\n  let guess = \"\";\r\n  while (guess == correct) {\r\n    guess = prompt(\"What is the password?\");\r\n  }\r\n  alert(\"You may enter.\");\r\n}\r\n\r\ngetPassword();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\r\n    \u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is not a very good password system. In fact, it lets everyone have access immediately! To correct this, we would need to change the `==` operator to `!=`, to make sure the `while` loop runs only until the correct password is entered.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly straightforward example, but for larger pieces of software logical errors can be much more complex and difficult to identify. Let's discuss some general strategies to help you deal with logical errors.\r\n\r\n## Strategies to Avoid Mistakes\r\n\r\nBelow are some general strategies and best practices you can follow to help you think through the structure and design of your programs.\r\n\r\n### Writing Pseudo-code\r\n\r\nOne common mistake for beginners in approaching code and coding problems is trying to solve a problem entirely in JavaScript. While this may seem like an obvious and commonsense approach, it is actually not always the best way to tackle a problem. Often, when creating complex programs, it is often useful to flesh out the structure and logic of your program before even writing any code or when faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem.\r\n\r\nThis practice is called __pseudo-coding__. Pseudo-code is an amalgamation of code-like expressions and regular English (or whatever natural language you are most comfortable with). There's no correct way to write pseudo-code--you make it up as you go along. As long as it looks a little bit like code and follows the same general pattern and procedure, you're doing well.\r\n\r\nThe reason we write pseudo-code is that it allows us to flesh out the logic of the program in a clear and accessible way. We use it to skip over unnecessary details in a way that we can easily convert into code later.\r\n\r\nHere's a possible example of pseudo-code for our simple password program from before:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate function get password\r\n    store correct password in variable\r\n    prompt user for password\r\n    while password is incorrect\r\n        prompt for password\r\n    alert user they may enter\r\n    end function\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, pseudo-code is a lot more readable than writing actual code. It provides you with an accessible blueprint of a program's logic and structure that you can then overlay or follow with actual code.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, there is no one way to write pseudo-code. You can be as detailed or as abstract as you'd like. As long as you are clarifying the structure of your program to yourself (and others you may be collaborating with), it is sufficient. It is often best, however, to write pseudo-code that more or less matches the syntax and vocabulary of JavaScript.\r\n\r\nWhenever you are beginning a new program, it is highly recommended to write pseudo-code first. Not only will it make the overall structure of your program more intelligible, but it will also help you to avoid making logical errors down the road.\r\n\r\n### General Tips\r\n\r\nHere are some more general tips for dealing with logical errors:\r\n\r\n1. Understand what your code is doing step by step.\r\n\r\nWith a logical error, code behavior is unpredictable. A loop may never happen, it may never end, or it might sometimes work right and sometimes not. The key to finding logic errors is to predict why the code is doing what it's doing and why it's not doing what you want. Follow through your code step by step, identifying _key changes of behavior_. \r\n\r\n2. Form a hypothesis or two before looking at the code. \r\n\r\nThink about what is wrong before you look over the code. Try to describe in plain English (or etc.) what is going wrong. Go through this process before you look at code. The moment you see code, you'll start worrying about details rather than thinking about the bigger picture. Logic errors are almost always about _logic_, and no amount of staring at code will show you the error.\r\n\r\n3. Resolve syntax errors.\r\n\r\nGo to the console and see if there are any syntax errors. If so, resolve them. Logic errors will not appear until you've resolved all syntax errors. If your code shows no syntax errors but still doesn't work correctly, you've got a logic error.\r\n\r\n4. Identify key variables or conditions.\r\n\r\nMost logic errors are centered around a condition that's not working right, and conditions are usually based on variables. Begin by taking a careful look at the conditions that control the behavior you're concerned about.\r\n\r\n5. Think about your logic.\r\n\r\nLogical errors aren't about getting the vocabulary right (remember, those are syntax errors). Logic errors are about telling the computer to do the wrong thing. The computer only does precisely what you tell it to do, so think hard about the logic you've applied and how you might be able to revise it.\r\n\r\n## Using console.log() to Debug\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, we have been console.logging a lot of our programs just so we can see an immediate result. However, `console.log()` is best used for debugging purposes in your programs. It is a quick and easy way to see the current state of a particular variable or condition. If you are ever uncertain about what result you might get from a particular piece of code, or if it is giving you an error or an otherwise unintended value, try breaking down the code step by step and using `console.log()` to see what is going on at each point.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that `console.log()` is useful no matter the data type: for instance, if you pass in an array, you'll be able to inspect the array's contents. Pass in an object, you can examine the object's attributes/methods. Pass in a string, it'll log the string. A good first step in any debugging process is to see exactly what you're getting back from the code. Pairing `console.log()` with `typeof` can also be particularly effective. Usually, this will give you some insight into what is going wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1.

Let's say you are writing a program that allows users to manage a collection of recipes. You want the user to be able to add, remove, edit, and search through their recipes. You also want the user to be able to \"favorite\" individual recipes and let them search and look through their list of favorites. Write some pseudo-code for a program that allows for each of these features.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\n- syntax error\r\n- type error\r\n- reference error\r\n- logical error\r\n- pseudo-code\r\n\r\n# VSCode and GitHub \r\n\r\nUp to this point we have been working entirely in the browser and our work has faded into the past at every screen refresh. Ephemerality is not a feature much appreciated in programming. So, to get started on something more permanent, let's set up a practice folder to hold our code. Call it `javascript`, or whatever you want, as long as you promise to remember it. Throughout the rest of this course, we will be working in this folder. \r\n\r\nClick this button to download a couple of files we'll be needing. Unzip the folder and add the files to your working folder.\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='index.html, script.js'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nNext, we'll want to get our coding environment set up. This will be the main focus of this particular lesson. We'll first install the VSCode code editor, and then learn how to set up and use a GitHub repository.\r\n\r\nMuch of your academic career has likely been structured around sending in single documents. For instance, a .pdf or Word document of your latest essay masterpiece. In general, however, going forward in this class you'll want to think of your work in terms of a __project__, which is a collection of files and code that you want to work on. In the coding environment we'll set up and the project we'll create, we'll be working with many files that will all contribute to the same overall project. A website, for instance, is a project, made up of many different files. What we will end up building by the end of this course will all be housed in the same folder and will be managed though a single GitHub repository. This will hopefully make more sense once we get into it.\r\n\r\nFor now, let's go ahead and install VSCode.\r\n\r\n## VSCode\r\n\r\nVSCode is a free and open-source code editor that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is a great tool for developers to use when they are working on code. It supports syntax highlighting, code completion, has built-in GitHub integration, and has an large library of extensions that can be used to extend its functionality.\r\n\r\n### Installing VSCode\r\n\r\nNavigate to the [homepage of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (stable version).\r\n\r\n![VSCode homepage](/images/vscode_homepage.png)\r\n\r\nOnce it is installed, open up the application. On the left sidebar, you'll see a few different options. Let's look at three of them:\r\n\r\n![VSCode sidebar](/images/vs_code_sidebar.png)\r\n\r\n- The Explorer Window is the main window that you'll be working with. It is the main way to navigate through your project and to interact with files.\r\n- The Search Window is a window that you can use to search for files or words throughout your project.\r\n- The Source Control Window will allow you to manage your project's files and code through GitHub integration.\r\n\r\nThese are the main windows you'll be working with, along with the main code editor area, in which you'll be writing code.\r\n\r\n### Opening a Project\r\n\r\nFor now, go ahead and open up the Explorer Window and click Open Folder. Navigate to your working folder for the course, select the folder, and click Select Folder.\r\n\r\nIn the Explorer, you should now be able to view both the `index.html` file and the `script.js` file, and can open them to view the code for each file.\r\n\r\n![New Project](/images/vscode_openproject.png)\r\n\r\nNext, let's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project.\r\n\r\n## Creating a GitHub Account\r\n\r\nThe first step we'll need to take is to set up a GitHub account. Navigate to the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/) and click \"Sign Up for GitHub\". You'll be prompted to create a new account.\r\n\r\n![GitHub Sign Up](/images/github_homepage.png)\r\n\r\n __Note:__ Although you don't have to, it is best to use your student email account (.edu) to register with GitHub, as this will allow you access to some features you otherwise would have to pay for.\r\n\r\n Work through the steps to create a new account and return here when you are finished.  \r\n\r\n## Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub\r\n\r\nNow that you have a GitHub account, let's go ahead and initialize a repository (folder) for our project. \r\n\r\nFirst, we should understand a little about how Git and Github work. __Git__ is a _version control system_ that allows you to track changes to your files. If you have used \"track changes\" in the past with either Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you're likely familiar with the terminology. In effect, you are tracking all of the \"versions\" or life-histories of your files stored in the repository.\r\n\r\n__GitHub__ is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching.\r\n\r\nA [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:\r\n\r\n- Developing software\r\n- Sharing data sets\r\n- Creating websites\r\n- Writing articles and books\r\n- Collating online resources\r\n- Keeping research notes\r\n- Hosting syllabi and course materials\r\n\r\nAlthough it has many benefits, using Git and GitHub effectively does take a bit of practice. It is notorious for being a bit of a pain in the neck (leading to such websites as [Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/)), but it is worth the effort.\r\n\r\n## Installing Git\r\n\r\nGit, as a version control system, can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future. It will also keep a record of all changes made in the past. It knows exactly when a file is added to a project and even when it is deleted. It can even resurrect files that have been deleted, if needed.\r\n\r\nLet's go ahead and install Git. \r\n\r\n### Installing on macOS\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest way is probably to open up the Terminal (search for it in Spotlight if you are unfamiliar with the terminal), type the following command and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have it installed already, it should prompt you to install it.\r\n\r\nYou can also find a macOS Git installer available for download [at the Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).\r\n\r\n### Installing on Windows\r\n\r\nThe most up-to-date build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to [the official download page](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and select the version you want to download (likely the 64-bit version).\r\n\r\n### Installing on Linux\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to install Git on Linux, depending on your distribution. You can find the official instructions for installing Git on Linux [on the Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).\r\n\r\n## Initializing a Git Repository on GitHub\r\n\r\nNext, let's go ahead and initialize a Git repository for our project. In VSCode, click on the Source Control Window and click on the `Initialize Repository` button.\r\n\r\n![Initialize Repository](/images/vscode_initgit.png)\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to see the following:\r\n\r\n![Initial Commit](/images/vscode_gitcommit.png)\r\n\r\nIn Git, every change you make to a file and submit to version control is called a __commit__. A commit is effectively a snapshot of a file or files at a certain point in time. Every commit also has a __commit message__, which is a short description of what the commit is all about, either for yourself or for others you are collaborating with. You should write a brief, descriptive message that encapsulates the changes you have made at that point in time.\r\n\r\nLet's go ahead and make our first commit. In VSCode, type \"First commit\" in the message window and click `Commit`.\r\n\r\nYou should receive a message that `There are no staged changes to commit`. \r\n\r\n![No Staged Changes](/images/vscode_nostaged.png)\r\n\r\nThis is because we haven't made any changes to any files yet and because we haven't __staged__ any files yet. Before making a commit, you need to add the files to the \"staging environment\". Staged files are those that are ready to be committed. This will make more sense later as we continue to work with Git.\r\n\r\nFor now, go ahead and click `Yes` to the prompt.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, you should see a button updated to `Publish Branch`.\r\n\r\n![Publish Branch](/images/vscode_publishbranch.png)\r\n\r\nGo ahead and click Publish Branch. You should be prompted to sign into GitHub. Go ahead and click `Allow`, and sign in to GitHub with your account.\r\n\r\nIf you receive a message to `Authorize VSCode`, click Authorize.\r\n\r\n![Authorize VSCode](/images/github_authorize.png)\r\n\r\nIf you are given additional messages to allow VSCode to access your account, click through to allow.\r\n\r\nLastly, you will want to give your repository a name. In VSCode at the top, you should see a text field window for typing the name of your repository. Give it whatever name you want, and click `Publish to public repository`. You can also create private repositories, but for this class we will make our repositories public.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, you should see a message that says `Successfully published to GitHub` in the lower right corner of VSCode. (If you also receive a message to `periodically run git fetch`, you can just say no for now.)\r\n\r\n![Successfully Published](/images/github_published.png)\r\n\r\nIf you click through to `Open in GitHub`, you should be able to see the repository you just created, along with a message of your first commit.\r\n\r\n![New Repository](/images/github_new_repository.png)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully created a new GitHub repository for this course.\r\n\r\nLet's go ahead and explore our files a bit, make a new change, and make a new commit to our repository.\r\n\r\n## Exploring our Files\r\n\r\nBack in VSCode, open up the Explorer Window and click on the `index.html` file. \r\n\r\n![index.html](/images/index_scrn.png)\r\n\r\nThis is an HTML file. It contains the code for the page that we will be working with. We will learn more about HTML in the next lesson.\r\n\r\nNow open the `script.js` file. As you can tell by the file extension (`.js`), this is a JavaScript file. It contains the code for the JavaScript that we will be working with.\r\n\r\nAs a project, each of these files is contributing to the webpage. We will learn more about how later, but for now let's look at the webpage in your browser.\r\n\r\nIn your file system, (not in VSCode), navigate to your folder containing these two files and double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following:\r\n\r\n![Hey it worked!](/images/heyitworked.png)\r\n\r\nIf you reference both files in VSCode, you can see that text from each is being reflected on the webpage. In the HTML file, we are displaying `This is my project!`. In the JavaScript file, we are providing an alert that says `Hey it worked!`.\r\n\r\n### Making a Change\r\n\r\nWithout worrying about the HTML for now, let's change the `Hey it worked!` message to `My project is going to be awesome!`. Go ahead and make the change in your code editor.\r\n\r\nIf you save the file now, you should see a new change being registered in the source control window.\r\n\r\n![Second Commit](/images/second_commit.png)\r\n\r\nThe number 1 in the source control icon indicates that there is one file change. If you click on it, you can see that it is tracking all the changes made to the file. The little `M` next to the file name indicates that the file is modified. \r\n\r\n### Staging our Change\r\n\r\nYou can also see a `+` (plus) sign next to the file name, which allows you to __stage__ a change for commit. Go ahead and click it. You should now see a section that says `Staged Changes`.\r\n\r\n![Staged Changes](/images/staged_changes.png)\r\n\r\n### Committing our Change\r\n\r\nNow that we have staged our change, let's go ahead and commit our change. Be sure to type a message for the commit, like `Second Commit` or `modifying text`.\r\n\r\n### Pushing our Changes to GitHub\r\n\r\nYou should now see a button that says `Sync Changes`. In the lingo of Git, this is called __pushing__ your changes. It is a way to send your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Simply committing your changes will _not_ make the changes on your remote repository until you push them. Let's go ahead and click `Sync Changes` and click `Ok`to the prompt.\r\n\r\nIf you navigate to your repository in GitHub, you should see a new commit with the message `Second Commit`.\r\n\r\n![New Commit](/images/github_secondcommit.png)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully pushed your changes to GitHub.\r\n\r\nUsing Git and GitHub might take a little getting used to, but it is a valuable resource for maintaining, sharing, and collaborating on projects. \r\n\r\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that the general process for working with Git is as follows:\r\n1. Make Changes\r\n2. Stage modified files\r\n3. Commit files with message\r\n4. Push to remote repository on GitHub\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1.

For this challenge, try changing the text that is displayed from the HTML page to whatever you'd like. Once you have made a change and see it reflected in the webpage, stage the change, commit it, and push it to GitHub with an appropriate message.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\r\n\r\n- Git\r\n- GitHub\r\n- stage\r\n- commit\r\n- push\r\n\r\n# HTML and CSS\r\n\r\nIn the last lesson we set up our project and created a repository on GitHub. Now that we have the environment set up and some files to work with, let's begin learning about writing HTML and CSS to modify a webpage. \r\n\r\nWe will be refreshing the page a lot, so the first thing I recommend doing is opening your `script.js` file in VSCode and commenting out `//` the alert that says `My project is going to be awesome!` so it doesn't become as much of an annoyance.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// alert('My project is going to be awesome!');\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo start us off and provide some context for this lesson, let's understand a bit about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.\r\n\r\n## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\r\n\r\n__HTML__ stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to define the _structure and content_ of a particular webpage. It allows you to add text, images, and other elements to a webpage, and to direct the overall layout of the webpage. For example, you can use HTML to add a header to your webpage, structure text in a series of paragraphs, add a table, a list of bullet points, an image, and much, much more. \r\n\r\nHTML works in tandem with __CSS__, which defines the _style_ of a webpage. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML directs the overall structure and content of a page, CSS is used to define the particular _stylistic or aesthetic appearance_ of the page. For example, you can use CSS to define the color of text, the font, the size, the background color, the color of elements like buttons, and much more. While you could create a webpage entirely using HTML, it would ultimately be a boring, uninteresting webpage with a white background and black Times New Roman text. This is precisely where CSS comes in.\r\n\r\nBoth HTML and CSS can also work in tandem with JavaScript files. While HTML and CSS direct the structure and style of a page, JavaScript allows you to add _functionality_ to a webpage. For example, you could use JavaScript to add a button that says \"Click Me!\" and when the button is clicked, it will display an alert that says \"Hey! A button was clicked!\". In other words, whatever the user can interact with on a webpage is controlled by JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the three languages are intertwined, and that you can write CSS and JavaScript inside an HTML file. This will make more sense as we continue learning.\r\n\r\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\r\n- HTML provides the _structure_ of a webpage.\r\n- CSS provides the _style_ of a webpage.\r\n- JavaScript provides the _functionality_ of a webpage.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, let's go ahead and dive into the basics of HTML.\r\n\r\n## HTML\r\n\r\nSo far, we have one HTML file to work with in our project: `index.html`. You can tell it is an HTML file by the `.html` extension. The name of the file (index) is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the index.html page as the opening page to your website directory. See [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/index-html-page-3466505) for more explanation.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the contents of the file. Open your project in VSCode and open the `index.html` file. You should see the following code display:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a standard layout for a basic HTML page. The first thing you'll probably notice is that HTML elements are defined by the `\u003c` and `\u003e` characters. Some tags need both opening and closing tags, like `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`, while others only need one tag, like `\u003cmeta\u003e`. Tags that are self-closing, or don't require closing tags, are called _void elements_. To close a tag when needed, add a `/` before the name of the element in the last tag.\r\n\r\nLet's break down some of the specific elements we are seeing here. The first element is a `\u003c!doctype\u003e` tag. This tag is used to define the type of document that is being created: in this case, an HTML doc. We also see an `\u003chtml\u003e` tag after. This tag begins the HTML document proper.\r\n\r\nWe also have a `\u003chead\u003e` tag. This element is where we put all of the background information, or _metadata_, about the webpage. None of this information is actually visible in a webpage except for the `\u003ctitle\u003e` tag, which will be displayed as the title of the page in your browser's title bar.\r\n\r\nNext, we have the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag. This tag begins the body of the webpage, where we put all of the actual content we want to display. In this case, we have a `\u003ch1\u003e` tag. This tag defines a header, or a large series of text, and it has a text content of `\"This is my project!\"`. For the moment, let's skip the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag--we'll discuss that later in the lesson. We end the HTML document by closing the `\u003c/body\u003e` and `\u003c/html\u003e` tags.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, the basic template for any HTML document is as follows:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n    \u003chead\u003e\r\n        \u003ctitle\u003eThis is the page title.\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003c/head\u003e\r\n\u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003ch1\u003eHere's an example large heading.\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is an example paragraph of text.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words...\r\n- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e`.\r\n- The HTML document itself begins with `\u003chtml\u003e` and ends with `\u003c/html\u003e`.\r\n- The `\u003chead\u003e` of the HTML document contains the metadata about the document, such as the `\u003ctitle\u003e`.\r\n- The visible part of the HTML document is between `\u003cbody\u003e` and `\u003c/body\u003e`, which can hold any number of elements you want to display.\r\n\r\n### Useful Tags\r\n\r\nThere are many tags you will find yourself using in HTML. Here are some of the most common:\r\n\r\n- `\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e`: This tag defines a paragraph of text.\r\n- `\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`: This tag defines a header, or a large series of text.\r\n- `\u003ch2\u003c/h2\u003e`: This tag defines a smaller header, or a smaller series of text. It descends all the way down to `\u003ch6\u003e`.\r\n- `\u003cimg src =\"...\" alt=\"Text for accessibility purposes\" /\u003e`: This tag sets an image to display, with an alternative text for accessibility. Note that it is a void element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.\r\n- `\u003ca href=\"...\"\u003e...\u003c/a\u003e`: This tag creates a hyperlink.\r\n- `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e`:  This tag designates a container block or section for other elements.\r\n- `\u003csection\u003e\u003c/section\u003e`: This tag creates a section of content.\r\n\r\nThere are many, many other tags you will encounter in the wild. You can find a complete list of tags here: [HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).\r\n\r\nIn your browser, you can observe the HTML for any page you encounter using the same browser's developer tools you used to open the console. It may not make much sense depending on the page you are looking at, but it can often be a good way to to simply get a glimpse of what the HTML looks like. Open the `index.html` page in your browser and right-click on the page and select `View Source`. You should be familiar with the code you are seeing.\r\n\r\n### HTML Attributes\r\n\r\nIn the `\u003chtml\u003e` tag in our `index.html` file, you'll also notice we have added `lang=\"en\"`. This is called an _attribute_. Attributes are pieces of information that are added to a tag element, and follow the syntax `attribute=\"value\"`. They allow us to modify the behavior of the element in a variety of ways or to add information. Here we wrote `lang=\"en\"` to define the language of the document as English (a common practice as info for the browser). \r\n\r\nYou'll also notice, in the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, that we added a `src` attribute. We'll discuss this in more detail later in this lesson. Throughout the course, you'll be introduced to a variety of useful attributes that you can use to modify elements in your HTML pages. For now, however, just keep in mind the syntax so you can recognize attributes when you see them.\r\n\r\nNow that we have some basic understanding of how an HTML document is set up, let's move on to CSS to add some style to our webpage.\r\n\r\n## CSS\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, HTML works in conjunction with CSS to define the style of a webpage. \r\n\r\nExamples of what CSS can help you modify include:\r\n- What background color you want to use for the page or a paragraph.\r\n- What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text.\r\n- How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left, or right.\r\n- Where elements appear on the page.\r\n- Whether elements are visible to a user or not.\r\n\r\nAnd much more! \r\n\r\n### Adding A New Stylesheet\r\n\r\nCSS files are called _stylesheets_. Let's create a new file called `styles.css` in our project so we can modify the style of our HTML page. The useful thing about stylesheets is that we simply need to create _one_, which will then control the layout of many different HTML documents.\r\n\r\nTo add a new file in VSCode, simply click on the \"New File\" button next to your project title in the Explorer window. Type `styles.css` into the name field and hit \u003ckbd\u003eEnter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Make sure to add the `.css` extension to the name.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll link to the `styles.css` file in our HTML file so it can be applied to our webpage. In our HTML file, we'll connect the files through a void `\u003clink\u003e` tag that lives inside the _parent_, or containing, `\u003chead\u003e` tag. Its `href` attribute is a link to our CSS document. The link tag is as follows:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `rel` attribute is used to define the relationship between the HTML document and the CSS document. In this case, the relationship is `stylesheet` because we are linking a CSS stylesheet. The `href` attribute is used to define the location of the CSS document. In this case, the location is relative to the location of the HTML document (it lives in the same folder), so we'll just provide the name of the CSS file.\r\n\r\nSo, open the `index.html` file in VSCode and add the `\u003clink\u003e` to the `\u003chead\u003e` section like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Styling Elements\r\n\r\nNext, let's start adding some styling to our page. In the `styles.css` file, let's add a background color. We'll do this by adding a `background-color` property to the `body` element. \r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\r\n  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nTo modify an HTML element, you first indicate which element you want to modify, followed by curly braces containing the properties you want to modify. In this case, we want to modify the `background-color` of the `body` element. Lines within the curly braces are called _declarations_, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each line in the declaration sets the value for a property and ends with a semicolon `;`.\r\n\r\nTo define the color, we use the `rgb()` function. This function takes three numbers as arguments that represent color values, and returns a color in the form `rgb(Red, Green, Blue)`. In this case, I'm using the RGB values for a purplish grey color, but you can use whatever color you'd like. VSCode usually comes equipped with a built-in color picker, so you can just click on the color you want and it will appear in the text field. If you can't see the color picker, you can also determine particular RGB values using [this online resource](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to get the RGB value you want along with analogous colors. \r\n\r\n__Note:__ High contrast is very important for people with visual disabilities. So, when designing websites always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the background color (or background image) is good! See [this very useful contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).\r\n\r\nIf you save the CSS file and open the HTML file in your browser, you should now see the background color change.\r\n\r\nNext, let's modify the header element a bit. Let's make it white, a different font, and a little bigger. We'll also set it to be bold and center it.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nh1 {\r\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\r\n    font-size: 50px;\r\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, each of these aspects have their own properties you can modify. If you add this code to your file and refresh your browser, you should see the header centered and modified accordingly.\r\n\r\nNext, let's add a paragraph with some text to our page. We'll start by adding a `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file, within the `\u003cbody\u003e`. I'm going to add a very bad (sorry!) joke to my site, but you can write whatever you'd like.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n    \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit his job?\r\n      A: Because he didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's add some styling to the paragraph. We'll follow the same process as we did for the header, but we'll make the text size a bit smaller (20px smaller, to be precise).\r\n\r\n```css\r\np {\r\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\r\n    font-size: 30px;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\r\n    white-space: pre-line;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other addition is the `white-space` property. This property allows you to control how whitespace is handled. In this case, I wanted to preserve the line break in the text so the question and answer are on different lines, so I set the value to `pre-line`.\r\n\r\nIf you save and reload, you should see something like the following:\r\n\r\n![First CSS styling](/images/1_css-styling.png)\r\n\r\n### CSS Selectors\r\n\r\nCSS is made up of selectors with specific properties. Selectors are usually tags, ids, or classes. Let's take a look at both of the latter selectors. `id` will allow us to select a single element by its id and modify it. `class` will allow us to efficiently modify a number of elements with the same class at once.\r\n\r\n#### Class\r\n\r\nIn our project page so far, we applied many of the same styles to the `\u003ch1\u003e` element as well as to the `\u003cp\u003e` element. For instance, we centered them both, made them both white, changed the font, etc. This works, but is ultimately repetitive and inefficient because we had to rewrite the same code. Using the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag and classes, we can make this much easier.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's create a class in our CSS file. We'll create a class called `formatText` and use it to style all the text on the page.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.formatText {\r\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\r\n    white-space: pre-line;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a class, we use the `.` (dot) character followed by the name of the class. We can then use the class in our HTML file. Let's use the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag, which acts like a container for other elements, and style it with our class. Everything within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag will then be styled according to the `.formatText` properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\r\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n      \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit his job?\r\n        A: Because he didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we use the `class` selector to style the `\u003cdiv\u003e` element with the name of the class we created. We include both text elements within the bounds of the `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag so they are both styled the same.\r\n\r\nBack in our CSS file, we can now delete the repetitive bits. Our `\u003ch1\u003e` element now only needs to be distinguished by font size and boldness...\r\n\r\n```css\r\nh1 {\r\n    font-size: 50px;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n...while our `\u003cp\u003e` element only needs to be distinguished by the text size.\r\n\r\n```css\r\np {\r\n    font-size: 30px;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll together, your CSS file should now look something like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n    background-color: rgb(118, 92, 120);\r\n  }\r\n\r\nh1 {\r\n    font-size: 50px;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n  }\r\n\r\np {\r\n    font-size: 30px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n.formatText {\r\n    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\r\n    white-space: pre-line;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave and reload the page, and you should see the same result as before. What, then, was the point? Well, by using classes we have reduced the amount of code we need to write and made it much more readable and organized. Classes are very useful when you know you want to style many elements at once with a number of common or generic properties. You can apply classes to almost any element, and every element can even have multiple classes! Just separate the names with a space, like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"firstClass secondClass thirdClass\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly powerful feature of classes.\r\n\r\n##### ID\r\n\r\nIn contrast to classes, IDs are unique. They are used to identify a _single_ element in the HTML file rather than many. This is useful when you want to style a single element, but you don't want to style every element with the same properties.\r\n\r\nLet's say we wanted to set our joke apart from the header text a bit. Let's add a border around the joke text and provide it with a different background and font color. Let's also add a second joke to the page.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways we could do this, but the best might be to use a _flexbox_. Flexbox is a method to lay out elements in a way that is more efficient than using absolute positioning (or manually figuring out height, width, and dimensions of the page). It is a way to allow for a dynamic positioning of elements on a particular page. This layout also makes elements responsive, which means that the elements change their behavior according to the kind of device displaying them. No matter if you are viewing the page on a mobile phone or a computer monitor, the elements will be provided with appropriate position and symmetry. In general, flexbox is one of the best methods for vertically and horizontally centering elements because it’s responsive and doesn’t require margin calculations.\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating a new section in our HTML file, and adding a new `id` of `joke` to designate it as the joke section. I'll also add a new bad joke, this time at the expense of academics:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype HTML\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy JavaScripting Master's Student Project\u003c/title\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"formatText\"\u003e\r\n      \u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n        \u003csection id=\"joke\"\u003e     \r\n          \u003cp\u003eQ: Why did the programmer quit his job?\r\n          A: Because he didn't get arrays.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n          \u003cp\u003eQ: What's the difference between an academic and a genie?\r\n          A: One grants wishes, the other wishes for grants.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n        \u003c/section\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that we have now designated a new `\u003csection\u003e` with an `id` of `joke`. Next, let's move to our CSS file to define the properties for the section.\r\n\r\nThe syntax for ids is mostly the same as classes, but instead of using the `.` (dot) character, we use the `#` (hash) character:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#joke {\r\n    border: 5px solid rgb(16, 29, 55);\r\n    background-color: rgb(118, 125, 158);\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    width: 50%;\r\n    margin: 0 auto;\r\n    color: rgb(255, 230, 204);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have several new things here, so let's break them down. First, we create a border around the joke text. We use the `border` property to set the border width (`5px` = 5 pixels) and style. `solid` indicates a solid fill border, and we set the color to a dark blue. We also use the `display` property to set the display type of our `joke` id to `flex`. This is defining our flexbox layout. We use the `flex-direction` property to set the direction of the layout to `column`. Flexboxes can utilize horizontal rows (this is defining their \"direction\") as well as a columnar structure. Choosing columns allows us to place jokes one below the other on our page and make it easier to read. In other words, each `\u003cp\u003e` element within the joke `\u003csection\u003e` will appear evenly spaced below the first as a long column of jokes.\r\n\r\n We then use the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to set the alignment of the elements to `center`. This means that the elements (the jokes) will be aligned in the center of the flex container. We use the `width` property to set the width of the overall flex container to 50% of the width of the screen, and we use the `margin` property to set the margin to `0 auto`. This means that the container will be centered on the screen (the margins will be even on each side and it will warp to 50% of the screen width). Finally, we use the `color` property to set the text color to a light peach color.\r\n\r\n If you save and reload the page, you should now see something like the following:\r\n\r\n![joke id](/images/2_css-styling.png)\r\n\r\nNice! You'll notice that even though the id is located within the `.formatText` class (i.e., the parent class) and that its styling is still being applied, you can nest ids and classes within each other to override the particular styling of the parent or container they are in. This allows you to create a complex hierarchy of styles that can be applied to many elements at once.\r\n\r\nBy creating a joke id we now have a specific section to hold and style all our terrible jokes. At this point I might encourage you to check out the [flexbox guide here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to learn a bit more about flexboxes, as they are incredibly useful for modern CSS.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while there are far, far too many CSS properties to cover in this course, I also urge you to at least peek through the [entire CSS reference library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and bookmark it. Try looking up the `flex` property, or any of the other properties we have used so far.\r\n\r\n### External, Internal, and Inline CSS\r\n\r\nAs a final note about CSS, in this course we are using an _external_ CSS file, meaning it is its own separate file that we have to link to in our HTML. This is the recommended way to utilize CSS. However, it is possible to use CSS directly in your HTML file as well, through both _internal_ and _inline_ methods. If you are curious, you can visit [this page to understand the differences](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) between these methods. In general, however, just keep in mind that using external CSS files is the preferred method of using CSS.\r\n\r\n## JavaScript\r\n\r\nSo far, we have just been using HTML and CSS to style our page. The only bit of JavaScript we have is linked through the `\u003cscript\u003e` tag, located in the `\u003cbody\u003e` of the HTML file:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"script.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `src` (source) attribute is used to link to the JavaScript file `script.js`. This is the file that contains the code that will be executed when the page loads. At the moment, the only thing it is doing is alerting the user that your project is going to be awesome.\r\n\r\nIn the next lesson, we will learn how to use JavaScript to create a more complex webpage with some actual interactivity. For now, let's just review some of the concepts we've learned so far concerning HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1. How do we associate a CSS stylesheet with a HTML file?

True or False - ids are created using the `.` (dot) character and classes are created using the `#` (hash) character.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True\r\n- False*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n3. True or False - Flexboxes are useful because they allow for a dynamic layout of elements on a page.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Add another joke of your own to the jokes section of your page.\r\n\r\n2. Add a link in the jokes section to an online list of jokes using the `\u003ca href=\"\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e` tag. To learn about this tag, [see this page](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_links.asp).\r\n\r\n3. Create a new `\u003csection\u003e` in your HTML file to display your favorite poem. In CSS, give it an appropriate id, and define the section as a centered flexbox with a different border, background color, and text color.\r\n\r\n4. Push all your changes to the project to GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you remember the meaning of the following terms?\r\n\r\n- self-closing or void tags\r\n- metadata\r\n- attributes\r\n- class\r\n- id\r\n- flexbox\r\n\r\n## Download the Project\r\n\r\nHere are the course files we created for this lesson if you need a reference:\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='8_index.html, 8_script.js, 8_styles.css'\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n# Interactive Web Design\r\n\r\nNow that you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, let's begin using JavaScript to add more interactivity to your webpage. \r\n\r\nJust as a note, for the rest of this course, we will be switching back and forth between environments (e.g., VSCode, the browser, the console) as well as between languages (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) fairly often. This might be a little confusing and disorienting at first, but with a bit of practice it will eventually begin to feel more natural. \r\n\r\nBefore we get to working with JavaScript, there are a few things we'll want to do. The first is to get a local server up and running so we can test our code on the fly, and the next will be to incorporate the jQuery library into our code. Let's accomplish these now.\r\n\r\n## Running a Live Server in VSCode\r\n\r\nSo far, we have simply double-clicked the `index.html` file in your computer's file system and opened it in the browser. This is a perfectly fine way to get started previewing our webpage, but it may cause issues as we add more complexity. To address this, let's add an extension to our VSCode that will allow us to run a local web server to load and preview our webpages.\r\n\r\nOpen up your project in VSCode. Next, click on the Extensions button in the sidebar.\r\n\r\n![vscode extension](/images/open_extensions.png)\r\n\r\nIn the search field, type `live server` and press enter.\r\n\r\nOpen the Live Server extension (it will likely be the first search result, see below for specifics), and click Install.\r\n\r\n![Live Server](/images/live_server.png)\r\n\r\nOnce installed, you should see a new button in the taskbar on the bottom-right of VSCode that says \"Go Live\".\r\n\r\n![Go Live](/images/go_live.png)\r\n\r\nClicking this button will open a new window that will load your webpage in the browser. Now, you can make changes to your page and, after saving the file in VScode, you can see your changes immediately reflected in the browser. Try changing some of the text on your page, saving it, and returning to your page in the browser. You should see your changes display, without even needing to reload the page. \r\n\r\nPretty neat, right?\r\n\r\nTo shut down the server, simply click on the button (now showing the port #) in the taskbar again.\r\n\r\n## Importing jQuery\r\n\r\nNext, we will incorporate the __jQuery library__ into our code. JQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that allows us to build our webpage without needing to reinvent the wheel in terms of common functionality. It takes many of the typical tasks that would usually take many lines of JavaScript or HTML code to accomplish, and simplifies them into functions that you can call with a single line of code. In short, it is a \"library\" in the sense that it provides us with many pre-written functions that we can use to make our webpage writing much more simple and efficient.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to import the jQuery library into our code. To do this, we need to add another script tag to our HTML file. Above the `script.js` import in the `\u003cbody\u003e`, add the following line:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are importing the jQuery library from the [jQuery CDN](https://code.jquery.com/) (Content Delivery Network). In other words, our `src` attribute is directed to the web server `code.jquery.com` and is told to download the source file `jquery-3.6.0.min.js`, which is the latest version of jQuery (at the time of writing this).\r\n\r\nNext, let's learn how to use jQuery to perform some basic tasks.\r\n\r\n## Using jQuery\r\n\r\n### Selecting Elements\r\n\r\nThe first function we will cover is the __jQuery selector__, which is one of the most important functions in jQuery. It allows us to select and manipulate HTML elements on our page. It is used to \"find\" HTML elements based on their name, id, class, type, and other attributes.\r\n\r\nAll selectors start with a dollar sign followed by parentheses: `$(\"\")`. A selector takes a single argument in the parentheses (set between double quotes `\"\"`), which is the element we want to modify. Let's look at some basic examples.\r\n\r\n### Selecting the Header\r\n\r\nCurrently, our header in the `\u003ch1\u003e` tag seems a bit unnecessary. All it is doing is telling us `This is my project!`, which is information we clearly already know (and which also doesn't do much for the visitor to the site). We could, of course, simply change the text to something more appropriate, but to show you the power of jQuery selectors, let's play around with this element a bit and see how we can use JavaScript to modify it.\r\n\r\nFirst, we could simply hide the header from our page so that visitors to the site would not see it. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"h1\").hide();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe begin by selecting `$` the `h1` element of our page, and then we use the `.hide()` method to hide the element. This will remove the header from view on our page, but keep it in our HTML code. Save the file and check out your page in the browser. The header with the message `This is my project!` should now be hidden from view.\r\n\r\nWhat happens now if we add a new header to replace the old one? Let's try it out. In your `index.html`, add a new header below the old one:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ch1\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file and check out your page in the browser. What happens?\r\n\r\nNothing, right? The new header is not visible to the visitor either. This is because by using the `$(\"h1\")` selector to hide, we are selecting _all_ the `h1` elements in our page. In other words, any `\u003ch1\u003e` tag we try to add will be hidden from view.\r\n\r\n### Selecting by ID\r\n\r\nLet's address this by utilizing an __ID selector__ instead. This will allow us to select a single element. In your `index.html`, let's define an id `noShow` for the header we specifically want to hide, like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ch1 id=\"noShow\"\u003eThis is my project!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003ch1\u003eBad Jokes Galore!\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n```\r\nNext, let's change our selector so that only the element with the id `noShow` is hidden instead of all `h1` elements. In your `script.js`, change the original hide code to the following:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#noShow\").hide();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo select by id, we use the `#` (hash) symbol followed by the id name (this is, as you might recall, the same when styling by id in CSS). If you save and view the page, you should now see the old header hidden from view, but the new header still visible:\r\n\r\n![id selector](/images/id_selector.png)\r\n\r\nGreat!\r\n\r\n...well, perhaps we think these jokes are getting too much flak. In fact, let's consider that these may actually be the best jokes ever. Why don't we change the text of the header to reflect this more positive attitude (no matter how misguided it may be)? We could, of course, simply change the text manually in the HTML file, but we can also use the `.html()` method to change the text of an element entirely in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIn your `script.js`, add the following line:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"h1\").html(\"The Best Jokes Ever!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you save and check your page, you should now see the header text changed to `The Best Jokes Ever!`. \r\n\r\n![change header](/images/change_header_text.png)\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, again, that because we are specifying the `h1` tag, this will change the text of _all_ `h1` elements in the page to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\" If you were to add another header anywhere on the page, it would also change the text to \"The Best Jokes Ever!\". This is clunky and wouldn't be advised for more complex webpages, but will work for now just for demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\n### Selecting by Class\r\n\r\nSelecting by class is the same as selecting by id, but instead of using the `#` symbol, we use the `.` (dot) symbol. You can select any class element with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\".className\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to modify or manipulate all elements with the class `className` in the page, just as you did with the id selector.\r\n\r\n### Appending Elements\r\n\r\nLet's say we wanted to add a new joke to our page. We could simply add a new `\u003cp\u003e` tag to our HTML file like we did in earlier lessons, but we can also add elements with jQuery. It makes sense to use JavaScript here anyway--for instance, what if we wanted users to be able to post their own jokes to the page? We would want a way to automatically update the list of jokes rather than doing it manually ourselves in HTML. \r\n\r\nSo, let's use the `.append()` method to add a new joke to our `joke` section. In your `script.js`, add the following line:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#joke\").append(\"\u003cp\u003eQ. What do you call a fake noodle? \u003cbr /\u003e A. An impasta\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are identifying the element with the id `joke` (used for our joke `\u003csection\u003e`) and adding a new paragraph `\u003cp\u003e` element to it. To keep a line break between the question and answer, we use the self-closing HTML `\u003cbr /\u003e` (break) tag in between. Save the file and check out your page in the browser.\r\n\r\n![append joke](/images/append_joke.png)\r\n\r\nCool, we now have three ~~terrible~~ amazing jokes on our page.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, keep in mind that...\r\n- `$(\"\")` is the jQuery selector.\r\n- To select an element by id, use `#` followed by the id name.\r\n- To select an element by class, use `.` followed by the class name.\r\n- You can use methods like `.hide()` and `.html()` and `.append()` to modify elements that you select. \r\n\r\n## Adding Interactivity\r\n\r\nOkay, we have learned how to use jQuery to select and manipulate elements on our page. However, we still don't have any real interactivity. As a basic example, let's add a button that will allow us to show and hide the jokes section from view on the page.\r\n\r\n### Creating a Button\r\n\r\nTo create the button, add the following code to your `index.html` file, underneath your header tags:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cbutton id=\"toggleJokes\"\u003eToggle Jokes\u003c/button\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have a simple `\u003cbutton\u003e` element set to an id `toggleJokes`. If you save your file, you should now see a button on the page above your jokes section.\r\n\r\nYou can see that it doesn't look very good at the moment, so why don't we add a bit of styling to make it better? Now, we could simply style the button in our CSS file like we did with other elements in the page. For example, to make the button orange, with larger white text, a border, some padding, and some margin space around the button to separate it from other elements, we could add the following code to our `style.css` file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#toggleJokes {\r\n    background-color: orange;\r\n    color: white;\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n    border: 1px solid white;\r\n    border-radius: 5px;\r\n    padding: 10px;\r\n    margin: 10px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are styling the button with the id `toggleJokes` using the CSS styling techniques we learned about earlier. This would probably be the best and most efficient way to style the button. However, you can also style an element entirely in JavaScript. Why don't we try this instead?\r\n\r\n### CSS Styling in JavaScript\r\n\r\nWe can use the `.css()` method to add styling to any element. For example, take a look at the code below:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// modify css styles for the button\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"background-color\", \"orange\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"color\", \"white\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"font-size\", \"20px\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"padding\", \"10px\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border-radius\", \"5px\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"border\", \"2px solid black\");\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css(\"margin\", \"10px\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we are modifying the the many CSS properties of the button with the id `toggleJokes`. When using the `.css()` method, you must specify the property name and the value you want to set it to. As you can see, we use the same properties and values as we do when writing regular CSS styles. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are very interwoven languages.\r\n\r\nInstead of writing a bunch of separate lines, we can also use the `.css()` method to modify the styles of multiple properties of an element at once. To do so, you simply wrap the properties in curly braces and separate them with a comma, writing them out as you would in a typical CSS style sheet:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// modify css styles for the button\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").css({\r\n    \"background-color\": \"orange\",\r\n    \"color\": \"white\",\r\n    \"font-size\": \"20px\",\r\n    \"padding\": \"10px\",\r\n    \"border-radius\": \"5px\",\r\n    \"border\": \"2px solid black\",\r\n    \"margin\": \"10px\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is functionally the same, but is cleaner and easier to read. Add this code to your `script.js` file and save your file. You should see something like the following:\r\n\r\n![Button Styling](/images/style_button.png)\r\n\r\nA bit ugly still, but at least it has some flavor. Again, while it is preferred to define your styles _within your CSS stylesheet_ (like we did initially), you can see how JavaScript can add dynamic styles to your elements as well. Each language forms a part of the whole to define the user's experience.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of user experience, if you try clicking on the button, you'll notice it doesn't do anything yet. Let's add some proper interactivity to it.\r\n\r\n### Making the Button Clickable\r\n\r\nWe'll want this button to both show and hide the jokes section. Now, we could write a somewhat complex function that would `hide()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (and when the text is displayed), while also `show()` the jokes section when the button is clicked (when the text is hidden), but here's an example of jQuery to the rescue, simplifying things for us. You can simply use the `.toggle()` method to toggle the display (visible/invisible) of a particular element.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, however, we need to make the button clickable in the first place. We can do this by using another jQuery method, `.click()`, which will add a click __event__ to the button. You can think of events as \"things that happen\" to your HTML elements (text fields being typed in, buttons being clicked, etc). So, in your `script.js`, add the following lines:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#toggleJokes\").click(function() {\r\n  $(\"#joke\").toggle();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst we select the button with the id `toggleJokes` and then add a click event to it. We attach a simple function to the `click()` event so it will run when the click occurs. This function selects the `joke` section and adds a `.toggle()` method to it.\r\n\r\nIf you save and check your page, you should now be able to click on the button and see the jokes section disappear and reappear. \r\n\r\nVery well done! You're already a successful web developer.\r\n\r\n## Additional jQuery Methods\r\n\r\nThere are many, many more jQuery methods available (way too many to cover). You can find a full list of them [here](http://api.jquery.com/).\r\n\r\nAs their slogan has it, with jQuery the intent is to \"write less, do more\". It allows you to very easily perform tasks and manage behaviors on your page without having to write lengthy, complicated code for common situations. As your web project grows more interactive, the potential for using more jQuery grows along with it.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1.

Note that you will have to save the image within your project folder to be able to load it into your page.\r\n\r\n2. Using selectors, give the image [rounded corners](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) in CSS or JavaScript.\r\n\r\n3. `Prompt()` the user whether the jokes on our page are good or bad. If the user responds with \"bad\", then change the header text to \"The Worst Jokes Ever!\". If the user responds with \"good\", keep the header text as \"The Best Jokes Ever!\".\r\n\r\n4. Add a button to the page that will change the page's overall color scheme (background color, text color, etc.).\r\n\r\n5.

In this lesson, we'll build a digital version of a famous poem that will allow users to click on aspects of the poem to see more information about the literary devices being used. It is meant to be an educational tool for anyone who is interested in the techniques utilized in the poem.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary note, this lesson might take you a bit longer to get through. We will be learning about a variety of important new concepts, so take your time and try to understand each step before moving on. \r\n\r\nAre you ready? \r\n\r\nLet's get into it!\r\n\r\n## The Poem\r\n\r\nBecause we are all in NYC and have likely experienced the throbbing, perpetual daylight of Times Square, as a dataset let's work with Walt Whitman's famous poem _Broadway_, published in 1888. Here is the poem in its entirety:\r\n\r\n    Broadway\r\n    Walt Whitman\r\n\r\n    What hurrying human tides, or day or night!\r\n    What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters!\r\n    What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!\r\n    What curious questioning glances- glints of love!\r\n    Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!\r\n    Thou portal- thou arena- thou of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups!\r\n    (Could but thy flagstones, curbs, facades, tell their inimitable tales;\r\n    Thy windows rich, and huge hotels- thy side-walks wide;)\r\n    Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet!\r\n    Thou, like the parti-colored world itself- like infinite, teeming,\r\n    mocking life!\r\n    Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!\r\n\r\nOur goal will be to create a page that prints these lines and turns certain parts into clickable elements. When the user does click, the page will display a message below the text that contains information about that element.\r\n\r\n## Setting Up the Page\r\n\r\nLet's create a new page specifically for our poem. Perhaps the simplest way for now will be to just create a link to our page in the `index.html` file. So, within the `\u003cdiv\u003e` container on your page, add the following code for a link:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"poem.html\"\u003eWalt Whitman's \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `\u003cem\u003e\u003c/em\u003e` tags stand for emphasis, which allows us to italicize words.\r\n\r\nNext, create a new file (by clicking the New File button in the VSCode Explorer Window) called `poem.html`. Paste into it this basic structure:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eWalt Whitman's Broadway\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"poem.css\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\r\n      \u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e by Walt Whitman\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"intro\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003eWelcome to the page for Walt Whitman's poem \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e. Click on elements to see more information about them.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n      \u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"poem\"\u003e\r\n      \u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"info\"\u003e\r\n      \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"poem.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see that we are adding a new dedicated stylesheet to work with `poem.css`, as well as a new script file to work with `poem.js`. Let's go ahead and create those now (again click New File \u003e `poem.css` and `poem.js`).\r\n\r\nUse the \"Go Live\" button to see your new page and make sure you are seeing the intro text display. \r\n\r\nNow that we have a page, let's convert our poem into usable JavaScript data.\r\n\r\n## Converting the Poem into Data\r\n\r\nWe have seen how both `arrays` and `objects` allow us to store large quantities of data. Here we have 11 lines of a poem, with a variable amount of words per line. We want to be able to manipulate each word as well as each line, if needed.\r\n\r\nWe could envision an array of `lines`, that stores another array of `words`. But, just like we did with our Student Grades program in a previous lesson, it would probably be best to create an `array` containing a series of `objects`. \r\n\r\nLet's take a look at what this might mean for the first line of the poem. \r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet line1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have the first line of the poem, broken up into words. Each word is an `object` with a `text` property that designates each word of the poem.\r\n\r\n### The `map()` Method\r\n\r\nTo perform an operation on each of these elements, we can use a new JavaScript method called `map()`. This method allows us to iterate over each element of an array and perform an operation (specifically, a function) on each element.\r\n\r\nThis method takes the function as an argument and runs that function's operations as it iterates. In doing so, it will create a new array that you can use to store the results of the function without altering the original array.  In short, you use `.map()` whenever you want to build an array out of another array. In this case, we want to create a new array that contains the text of each word in the poem.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet line1TextArray = []\r\nline1TextArray = line1.map(function(word) {\r\n  return word.text;\r\n}); \r\n```\r\n\r\n`.map()` here creates a new array out of the array of word objects, and this new array contains just the `.text` property (the words) of each object. \r\n\r\nNow, we can put the phrase back together using another new method.\r\n\r\n### The `join()` Method\r\n\r\nThe `join()` method returns an array as a string. In other words, when applied to our array of words, it will return them together as a string, with spaces in between each word.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet line1Text = line1TextArray.join(\" \");\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's put it all together in our `poem.js` file to see what it looks like.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\r\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\"}, {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \r\n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\nline1Text = line1.map(function(word){\r\n    return word.text;\r\n    }).join(\" \");\r\n$(\"#poem\").html(\"\u003cp\u003e\" + line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you save and check your page in the browser, you should see that we have successfully displayed the first line of the poem.\r\n\r\n![Poem first line](/images/poem_first_line.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Information to the Poem\r\n\r\nNext, we'll want a way to display information about certain elements of the poem. To indicate which ones, we can add another property to specific word objects. Let's add a new property `info` that will provide information about the literary device being used.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n    line1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \r\n        {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \r\n        {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you can see that we have added a new `info` property to the first word of the poem to describe the technique of [anaphora](https://literarydevices.net/anaphora/). \r\n\r\nThis way, we can send this info down to the `#info` div on the page when the user clicks the word. \r\n\r\n## Making Elements Clickable\r\n\r\nYou might recall our brief discussion of _events_ in the previous lesson. Events are the actions that occur when a user interacts with a certain element. For instance, when a user clicks on a button, a certain event occurs. \r\n\r\nWe want the user to be able to click on a word to find the appropriate information about it. Do you recall how we might accomplish this?\r\n\r\nWe can use the `click` event, of course! It will allow us to listen for a user's click on a certain element. To do this, however, we'll need to revamp our code a bit. We want to use word-size chunks of data here, so we'll need to get rid of our `.join()` method from before and instead iterate through the array word by word.\r\n\r\nFor now, just paste the following to overwrite all your current code:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\r\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \r\n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \r\n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\r\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\r\nline1.map(function(word){\r\n  // Add in the word object’s .text property plus a space.\r\n  line1Text = line1Text + word.text + \" \";\r\n});\r\n// Break the line and close the two tags.\r\nline1Text = line1Text + \"\u003cbr /\u003e(line 2 would go here)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\r\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you save and check your page, you'll see functionally the same result as before. We use the `map()` method to iterate through the array of word objects, setting `line1Text` to the `.text` property of each word object and add spacing. We then use the `.html()` method to set the `#poem` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the string we created. \r\n\r\nNext we'll want to check if a specific word has an `info` property. We can accomplish this by using an `if` statement within our `map()` method, like so:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nline1.map(function(word){\r\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\r\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\r\n  let wordString;\r\n  wordString = word.text;\r\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\r\n  if (word.info){\r\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\r\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n  }\r\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\r\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\r\n});\r\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each word in the array, we check to see if it has an `info` property using an `if` statement (if word.info == True). If it does, we add an `\u003ca\u003e` tag to the word, which will turn the word element into a clickable link. By capturing this in `wordString`, we can add it to the overall `line1Text` string phrase as usual. Otherwise, `wordString` will just be the word itself and get added as well.\r\n\r\nIf you save, you should be able to see the poem with \"What\" now clickable. If it you do click it, however, nothing will happen yet. Let's add in our `click` event listener:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(\"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on a word!\u003c/h2\u003e\");\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you save and click on the word now, you should see \"This is where the info will go\" replaced by \"You clicked on a word!\". What's happening here is that we're listening for a click on every element in the page marked with an `\u003ca\u003e` tag (by using `#poem a`). Because we marked \"What\" with an `\u003ca\u003e`, the `.click` event knows to trigger. When that happens, we're setting the `#info` `\u003cdiv\u003e` to the text \"You clicked on a word!\".\r\n\r\nAll together, the code looks like this: \r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eThe info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\nlet line1, line1Text; // don’t need the intermediate step of line1TextArray\r\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \r\n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides\"}, \r\n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\n// Create a blank string that opens two tags.\r\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // opening tags for blockquote and p, we close them in the loop below\r\nline1.map(function(word){\r\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\r\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\r\n  let wordString;\r\n  wordString = word.text;\r\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\r\n  if (word.info){\r\n    // If it does, surround wordString in an \u003ca\u003e tag.\r\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n  }\r\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\r\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\r\n});\r\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\r\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\r\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay, we now have clickable elements that allow us to display info about words. However, we want to actually display the info in the `info` property we wrote out.\r\n\r\nThere are a few steps we'll need to take to carry this out.\r\n\r\n## Accessing the Info Property\r\n\r\nWe have two things to accomplish here. First, we want to send specific information to the `#info` div. Second, we want that data to be the `info` property of the word that was clicked.\r\n\r\nLet's tackle the first part. We'll need to modify our `click` event:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    // Define the text and the word that was clicked.\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord;\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\r\n    infoText = \"\u003ch2\u003eYou clicked on the word: \" + clickedWord + \"\u003c/h2\u003e\";\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have a new element introduced here: the keyword `this`. In this context, `this` indicates a reference to the object that is currently being acted upon (e.g., whatever word that was just clicked). In short, we can use `this` to access the `.text` property of the word that was just clicked, whichever word that may be.\r\n\r\nWe haven't quite accomplished what we want here, but we're getting there. We can now access at least the `.text` property of the word that was clicked, but we still need to get at the `.info` property.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we'll need to use __data attributes__. Data attributes allow us to store data on an element and access it. They are custom-made attributes that we can apply on HTML elements.\r\n\r\nLet's make one, called `data-info`, and use it to modify the string of text we create in our `.map()` method:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nline1.map(function(word){\r\n  // Define a variable that will be the entirety of a single\r\n  // word-sized chunk of information.\r\n  let wordString;\r\n  wordString = word.text;\r\n  // Test to see if the .info property exists.\r\n  if (word.info){\r\n    // Add the data-info attribute to the word.\r\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n  }\r\n  // Add wordString plus a space to the line1Text.\r\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have added a new data attribute and utilized it to store the `.info` property of the word that was clicked. Be careful about copying this correctly: you'll notice that we need to close the opening `\u003ca` and `data-info` attribute with a `\u003e` closing tag, as well as correct opening and closing quotes to indicate the info is a string.\r\n\r\nIf you check the HTML element inspector in your browser, you should see that the info text is now stored in the `data-info` attribute.\r\n\r\nWe can now access this data attribute in our `click` event listener, using the `.data` method:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo; //variables to capture the info text and the clicked text/info\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text(); // get the clicked word\r\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute.\r\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\"); // get the info from the clicked word using .data\r\n    infoText = clickedInfo; // set the info text var to the clicked info\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText); // change the info div to the info text\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you save and try to click on the word now, you should be rewarded with the info that was stored in the `.info` property about anaphora.\r\n\r\nOkay! So far so good. We've added in the ability to display info about words. However, all we currently have is one line of text. Surely we'd like to add _all_ the lines of the poem, right? Let's go about doing that now.\r\n\r\n## JSON\r\n\r\nTo use our dataset (our poem) more efficiently, we'll use JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. We can use a JSON object (as a separate file) to store our poem data, and then use that data to populate our poem. \r\n\r\nJSON, as a data format, allows us to store data in a structured way and utilize it in a variety of ways in JavaScript. Like object syntax you have seen so far, JSON object data is written in key/value pairs. For instance, here's a object containing details about an example person named Sal Ami in JSON:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n   \"firstName\": \"Sal\",\r\n   \"lastName\": \"Ami\",\r\n   \"age\": 30,\r\n   \"streetAddress\": \"404 JavaScript Dr\",\r\n   \"city\": \"JavaTown\",\r\n   \"state\": \"JA\",\r\n   \"postalCode\": \"12345\",\r\n   \"phoneNumbers\": [\r\n      { \"Mobile\": \"111-111-1111\" },\r\n      { \"Home\": \"222-222-2222\" }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we store data in key/value pairs as usual, and we can use both object and array syntax.\r\n\r\nUsing JSON, we can store our poem in a file called `poem.json`. As you might imagine, writing it all out is a bit of a pain, so luckily for you I've already done it. Download the `poem.json` file from the button below and save it to your working folder.\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='poem.json'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nIf you open the file in VSCode, you can see that we have stored the lines of the text in a similar fashion as we did before, with a `text` property for each word of the poem. I also went ahead and added a few extra literary devices for the first half of the poem and listed them as `info`. \r\n\r\nIn general, just keep in mind that:\r\n1. JSON objects are very much like JavaScript objects.\r\n2. JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.\r\n3. JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces `{ }`.\r\n4. Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).\r\n5. Keys and values are separated by a colon.\r\n6. Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.\r\n7. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` and each element is separated by a comma.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a full JSON file with our poem, let's use it to populate our page with the text. We'll need to revamp our code one more time to accomplish this. \r\n\r\nTo clearly observe the logic of what we have so far, let's take a look at the 3 different parts to our program:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\n\r\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\r\nlet line1, line1Text;\r\nline1 = [{text:  \"What\", info: \"Anaphora: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of (usually successive) lines. For example, the use of What in the first four lines.\"}, \r\n    {text: \"hurrying\"}, {text: \"human\"}, {text: \"tides,\"}, \r\n    {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"day\"}, {text: \"or\"}, {text: \"night!\"}];\r\nline1Text = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; \r\nline1.map(function(word){\r\n  let wordString;\r\n  wordString = word.text;\r\n  if (word.info){\r\n    wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\"+ word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n  }\r\n  line1Text = line1Text + wordString + \" \";\r\n});\r\n$(\"#poem\").html(line1Text);\r\n\r\n// Part 3 - Add the click event to the poem\r\n$(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\r\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\r\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have deleted all the earlier comments, so just look at the three new ones I've added here. We can see that we have 3 parts to our program:\r\n- Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\r\n- Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access `info` from the poem object if it exists\r\n- Part 3 - Add the click event to the poem\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we'll need to revamp part 2 to display the full data from the JSON file instead of just the first line we manually inputted. Let's do just that. We'll use the `getJSON` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. We'll also create a new variable that will store all the text of the poem garnered from the JSON file.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\n\r\n// Part 2 - Display the first line of the poem and access info from the poem object if it exists\r\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\r\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\r\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\r\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\r\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\r\n    // Define a blank lineText.\r\n    let lineText = \"\";\r\n    // Now iterate over each word. This part should be familiar to you from before\r\n    line.map(function(word){\r\n      let wordString;\r\n      wordString = word.text;\r\n      if (word.info){\r\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n      }\r\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\r\n    });\r\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\r\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\r\n  });\r\n  // Close the poemText tags\r\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\r\n  // Replace the content of #poem\r\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\r\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event to the poem\r\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\r\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\r\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\r\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\r\n  });\r\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is some new syntax and logic here, so try to follow along with the comments. We're first using a selector and the `getJSON()` method to retrieve the data from the JSON file. `getJSON()` takes two arguments: the source of the JSON file, and what's called a __callback function__. Callback functions are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions. In this case, we're passing in a function that takes one argument, which is the `data` from the JSON file.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the essential moves of the code are as follows:\r\n- Run the `getJSON()` method, passing in the `poem.json` file as the source.\r\n- Call the callback function, passing in the `data` variable (the JSON object).\r\n- Create a new variable to hold all the text of the poem.\r\n- `map()` over the data variable's `lines` property.\r\n- `map()` over each word in each line.\r\n- Make elements clickable if they have `info` data.\r\n- Add each line to the `poemText` variable with a line break, and add the text to the `#poem` element.\r\n- Run the `click()` method on the `#poem` element, to see if the user clicks on a word.\r\n\r\nAll together, your program should now look something like this:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n//Part 1 - Define the extra information section for the poem\r\n$(\"#info\").html(\"\u003cp\u003eExtra info will go here.\u003c/p\u003e\");\r\n\r\n// Part 2 - Display the poem and allow for clicking on words\r\n$.getJSON(\"poem.json\", function(data){ // data variable is the JSON object\r\n  let poemText; // Define a new variable to hold all text\r\n  poemText = \"\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"; // Open the starting tags\r\n  // Now you can iterate (map) over the data variable’s .lines property:\r\n  data.lines.map(function(line){ // We get a variable, line\r\n    // Define a blank lineText.\r\n    let lineText = \"\";\r\n    // Now iterate over each line. This part should be familiar to you from before\r\n    line.map(function(word){\r\n      let wordString;\r\n      wordString = word.text;\r\n      if (word.info){\r\n        wordString = \"\u003ca href='#' data-info='\" + word.info + \"'\u003e\" + wordString + \"\u003c/a\u003e\";\r\n      }\r\n      lineText = lineText + wordString + \" \"; // Add the word to the lineText variable with spacing\r\n    });\r\n    // Add lineText with a line break to the poemText\r\n    poemText = poemText + lineText + \"\u003cbr/\u003e\";\r\n  });\r\n  // Close the poemText tags\r\n  poemText = poemText + \"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\";\r\n  // Replace the content of #poem\r\n  $(\"#poem\").html(poemText);\r\n  // Now that we have the data, we can add the click event to the poem\r\n  $(\"#poem a\").click(function(){\r\n    let infoText, clickedWord, clickedInfo;\r\n    clickedWord = $( this ).text();\r\n    // .data(\"info\") looks for the data-info HTML attribute\r\n    clickedInfo = $( this ).data(\"info\");\r\n    infoText = clickedInfo;\r\n    $(\"#info\").html(infoText);\r\n  });\r\n}); // Close the getJSON method and callback function\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave and check the page. You should now see the full poem and have a few clickable elements to explore.\r\n\r\nCongrats! You now have a workable dataset and some interesting ways to display and interact with it. We've covered quite a lot of new terrain in this lesson, but for the most part, we are still just utilizing the foundational skills and tools you've encountered so far. \r\n\r\nIn the next lesson, we'll introduce a brand new tool called Leaflet. We'll learn how to use Leaflet to add interactive maps to our web pages.\r\n\r\nBut, as major takeaways from this lesson, just keep in mind that:\r\n- We usually want to break down data into smaller, discrete pieces we can manipulate\r\n- JSON allows you to store data in a structured way and work with it\r\n- Data attributes are used to store extra information that you may want to access or display\r\n- Events are used to trigger actions when something happens\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1. True or False - `map()` allows you to iterate over an array, but it doesn't return anything.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True\r\n- False*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. True or False - We can import a JSON dataset as an `object` in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n3. The following code would affect which element?\r\n\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#poem h3\").click(function(){\r\n    // some action\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- The paragraph element\r\n- The header element*\r\n- The info element\r\n- The body element\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Our poem page is quite bland. Spruce it up however you'd like by marshalling your CSS skills.\r\n\r\n2. `.map()` is an important method. Get a little practice in by writing a new function that takes an array of integers and, using `.map()`, returns an array of those integers, doubled. So if we give it [1, 2, 3], we receive, in turn, [2, 4, 6]. Display this info in the console.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor language=\"JavaScript\"\u003e\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n3. `.map()` is similar to another method, `.forEach()`. We haven't covered the latter, but you may encounter it in the wild. Read through [this article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-map-vs-foreach-f38111822c0f) to understand the differences between the two, and to learn a little more about `.map()` specifically.\r\n\r\n4. Add a new property to the JSON file that stores a wiki link for a particular literary device (e.g., [here for anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(rhetoric%29). Create a new data attribute to access this property and add it to the info message that is displayed when clicked. \r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\r\n\r\n- `.map()`\r\n- `.join()`\r\n- `.getJSON()`\r\n- data attributes\r\n- events\r\n- callbacks\r\n\r\n## Download the Project\r\n\r\nHere are the course files we created for this lesson if you need a reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='10_index.html, 10_script.js, 10_styles.css, 10_poem.html, 10_poem.css, 10_poem.js, poem.json'\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n# Mapping With Leaflet\r\n\r\nThe last lesson exposed us to a variety of good programming practices. For instance, we separated out our data into a JSON file instead of simply creating a `line1`, `line2`, `line3`, ... `line11` set of arrays to populate our poem. While that also would have worked, it is repetitive and inefficient. Instead, we made some basic assumptions about our data (that a `.lines` property could exist as an array of word objects that we could `.map()` over) and followed that approach, creating a new JSON file object. Separating out our logic for the program and the data we were working with is a good example of a __modular__ programming approach:  of separating out our code into smaller building blocks that ultimately work together to create a whole project. We have already been doing this with our HTML, CSS, and JS files, but we can do it with our data as well.\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, we'll work with a new tool called __Leaflet__. Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library (like jQuery) that will help us add interactive maps to our web pages. Interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data. What this will ultimately require us to decide is how to aggregate, categorize, combine, and visualize our data. All of these decisions, plus the context of the map on your page, will influence the story that the map tells. Thinking about your data as a story (no matter what the data is), is a good way to reckon with the ethical dimensions of web development.\r\n\r\nOn that note, and given current events, it is probably worth mentioning that Leaflet was created by a Ukrainian programmer in Kyiv. On the library's [main page](https://leafletjs.com/), you can read about the maintainers' sentiments on the war. This is a good time to reflect on how even well-established programming libraries can be affected by social and political forces, and also how they can be utilized in ways that were once unimaginable.\r\n\r\nKeeping these ideas in mind, let's get started working with Leaflet.\r\n\r\n## Web Maps\r\n\r\nYou are likely very familiar with web maps. I personally have found myself quite lost in NYC before. While \"being lost\" is not necessarily a bad way of being sometimes, if you have a specific destination (not to mention a certain time) in mind, having a map is quite helpful. You know what I mean--Google or Apple provide us with interactive geo-location almost every second of our lives.\r\n\r\nBefore we begin integrating web maps into our project, it might be helpful to consider the basic \"layering\" of a web map. Take a look at the map below. It was created using Leaflet, and you can see some of the code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) powering it on the side. Click on stuff and zoom and drag around on the map.\r\n\r\n\u003cHTMLEditor \u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chtml\u003e\r\n \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"/\u003e\r\n \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n\u003ccss\u003e\r\n#map {\r\n    height: 600px;\r\n    width: 600px;\r\n}\r\n\u003c/css\u003e\r\n\u003cjavascript\u003e\r\n```\r\nvar map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\r\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\r\n\tmaxZoom: 19,\r\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\r\n}).addTo(map);\r\nL.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)\r\n    .bindPopup('Here is a pop-up\u003cbr\u003e on a marker')\r\n    .openPopup();\r\n```\r\n\u003c/javascript\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/HTMLEditor\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that there are several \"layers\" to this map. Web maps can be layered in many ways, but the most basic can resolve into just a few:\r\n1. The background or tile layer--the map itself, with all its internal data about streets, boroughs, cities, etc.\r\n2. The foreground layer--the parts that overlay the map: the markers, lines, and other elements.\r\n3. The popup layer--the text or notification that appears when you click on a marker or other element on the map.\r\n4. The control layer--the buttons that control the map, such as the zoom buttons. This layer is usually on top of the other layers.\r\n\r\nThese layers all work together to comprise the interactivity of the map. For our purposes, we will mostly work with the foreground layer and the popup layer.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started with Leaflet\r\n\r\nLeaflet is fairly straightforward to get started with and allows for a wide array of customization.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the JavaScript code for the map above, you'll notice a bunch of `L`s. Leaflet creates an object, `L`, that has a bunch of methods that we can use to create and manipulate maps. Our map is, itself, an object. The tile layer? A different object. Markers are objects, polylines are objects, polygons are objects, popups are objects--you get the point. And all these objects have properties and methods we can modify, too.\r\n\r\nTo better understand how this all works, let's get to work setting up our own map. Leaflet has an official [quick starter guide here](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) that we'll more or less follow, but we'll add some more context. \r\n\r\nLet's say we want to add a map of New York to our page with Whitman's _Broadway_ poem. Using Leaflet, let's get a map to show and add a bit of spatial context to our page.\r\n\r\n## HTML\r\n\r\nFirst, open your `poem.html` file. My recommendation here is to simply overwrite all your existing HTML by copy/pasting the following:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eWalt Whitman's Broadway\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha512-hoalWLoI8r4UszCkZ5kL8vayOGVae1oxXe/2A4AO6J9+580uKHDO3JdHb7NzwwzK5xr/Fs0W40kiNHxM9vyTtQ==\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"\"/\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha512-BB3hKbKWOc9Ez/TAwyWxNXeoV9c1v6FIeYiBieIWkpLjauysF18NzgR1MBNBXf8/KABdlkX68nAhlwcDFLGPCQ==\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"poem.css\"\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\r\n      \u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e by Walt Whitman\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"intro\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003eWelcome to the page for Walt Whitman's poem \u003cem\u003eBroadway\u003c/em\u003e. Click on elements to see more information about them.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n      \u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"poem\"\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"info\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n      \u003ch2\u003eMap of New York\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"map.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"poem.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice we have added a few new things here. First, before our `poem.css` file, we added a new `\u003clink\u003e` tag to link to Leaflet's CSS file. You _must_ always include Leaflet's CSS file in the `\u003chead\u003e` section of your documents when adding maps. Also in the `\u003chead\u003e` we added a new `\u003cscript\u003e` tag to link to Leaflet's JavaScript file. _This is also required_ for Leaflet to work.\r\n\r\nNext, within our `\u003cdiv\u003e` `container`, we added a new `\u003cdiv\u003e` with an `id` of `map` at the end. This is where we'll put our map. It will appear underneath the poem and info divs. To offset it a bit, we also included a new `\u003ch2\u003e` tag with the text \"Map of New York\" to appear above the map.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have added a new `\u003cscript\u003e` tag to link to our own new JavaScript file named `map.js`. This is where we'll add our own JavaScript code for the map.\r\n\r\nEverything else in the HTML should be familiar to you. This will be about all the work we need to do on our HTML file in this lesson.\r\n\r\n## CSS\r\n\r\nThe next step we'll need to take is to specify a height for our map. Leaflet's one demand of CSS is that it be a certain height. We can do this by adding a `height` property to our `#map` id. In your `poem.css` file, add the following:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n#map {\r\n  height: 400px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can change the height to whatever you'd like, but it must be there.\r\n\r\nIf you save your files and click \"Go Live\", you should see our new header with a considerable amount of whitespace beneath it. That is where our map will live. Currently, however, the map is not visible. This is because we need to initialize the map in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Initializing the Map\r\n\r\nCreate a new file called `map.js` and add the following:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// Create a new Leaflet map\r\nlet poemMap;\r\npoemMap = L.map(\"map\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n`poemMap` is now designated an object that we can use to modify the map on the page. Note the syntax: `.map()` is a method that `L` (Leaflet) has that creates a map in the `\u003cdiv\u003e` with the `id` given as the parameter. (`L.map()` here is not to be confused with the ordinary `.map()` method you've seen before! A little confusing, I know...) If you save everything and check the browser, you should see a map element appear.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the map is currently blank and grey. This is because we have not yet added a tile layer to the map. Remember, the tile or background layer is the map itself, with all its internal data about streets, boroughs, cities, etc.\r\n\r\nLet's go ahead and add the tile layer now. Below the initialization of the map, add the following:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\r\n\tmaxZoom: 18,\r\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\r\n}).addTo(poemMap);\r\n\r\npoemMap.setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 16);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at what this code does. First, we add a new `.tileLayer` to the map. The first parameter is the URL of the tile layer source (in this case, [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)). The second parameter is an object that contains the following properties:\r\n\r\n- `maxZoom`: The maximum zoom level that the map can be zoomed to.\r\n- `attribution`: The attribution text (to show the source of the map) that appears at the bottom of the map.\r\n\r\nWhenever we create a new object like this `tileLayer`, we need to add it to the map. We do this by calling the `.addTo()` method on the object. This method takes one parameter, which is the map we want to add the tile layer to (`poemMap`).\r\n\r\nNext, we use the `.setView()` method. This method takes two parameters: an array of the latitude (north-south) and longitude (east-west) of the center of the map, and the zoom level. We set the center of the map to New York City (using its coordinates) and the zoom level to 16. As we specified earlier, the max zoom level here is 18.\r\n\r\nIf you save and check your page, you should now see a map with New York City at its center. Nice!\r\n\r\n## Adding Markers\r\n\r\nBecause our poem is about Broadway, why don't we add a marker to the map indicating where Times Square is located? We can get the official coordinates of Times Square simply by Googling \"Times Square coordinates\". The result is 40.7580 N, and 73.9855 W. Let's add a marker to the map at these coordinates:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst timesSquare = L.marker([40.7580, -73.9855]).addTo(poemMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, we create a new `.marker()` object. This object takes one parameter, which is an array of the latitude and longitude of the location we want to mark. We then add this marker to the map.\r\n\r\nIf you scroll up on the map or zoom out, you should now see a marker appear at the coordinates. Next, let's add a popup to the marker. To do this, we need to add a `.bindPopup()` method to the marker. This method takes one parameter, which is simply the text we want to appear in the popup.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\ntimesSquare.bindPopup(\"\u003cb\u003eTimes Square\u003c/b\u003e\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we bind the popup to the marker with the bold text \"Times Square\". If you save and click on the marker, you should now see the popup appear.\r\n\r\n![Times Square](/images/times-square.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Shapes\r\n\r\nBesides popups and markers, you can add shapes to the map like lines, polygons, and circles. Let's add a circle to the map.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst circle = L.circle([40.7580, -73.9855], {\r\n    color: 'red',\r\n    fillColor: '#f03',\r\n    fillOpacity: 0.5,\r\n    radius: 500\r\n}).addTo(poemMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have added a circle with a radius of 500 meters. The circle is reddish (in terms of both border and fill) and has a 50% opacity so we can see the map underneath. To add the circle, we simply need to specify the coordinates of the center and add it to the map with the `.addTo()` method.\r\n\r\nWe can also add polylines to the map. Let's add a polyline from Times Square to the Graduate Center:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst polyline = L.polyline([\r\n    [40.7580, -73.9855],\r\n    [40.7486, -73.9840]\r\n], {\r\n    color: 'blue'\r\n}).addTo(poemMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we simply need to specify the start and end coordinates of the polyline. We can also specify the color of the line.\r\n\r\nLines, circles, and polygons are usually used to show a path or provide some contextual boundaries. We can also bind a popup to a line, circle, or polygon. For example, let's add a popup to the line from Times Square to the Graduate Center:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\npolyline.bindPopup(\"\u003cb\u003eTimes Square to the Graduate Center\u003c/b\u003e\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you click on the line on the map, you should now see a popup appear.\r\n\r\nYou can similarly add popups to circles and polygons. Let's add a popup to the circle:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\ncircle.bindPopup(\"I'm a circle!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Coordinates and Events\r\n\r\nLeaflet has many methods for working with coordinates. For example, we can get the latitude and longitude of a marker by calling the `.getLatLng()` (getLatitudeLongitude) method:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst latLng = timesSquare.getLatLng();\r\nconsole.log(latLng.lat);\r\nconsole.log(latLng.lng);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you check your console in the browser, you should now see the latitude and longitude of our Times Square marker display.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to pan (or shift the map's view) to Times Square, we could do so by calling the `.panTo()` method on the map:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\npoemMap.panTo(timesSquare.getLatLng());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you check your page, you should now see the map shift to the location of the Times Square marker.\r\n\r\nEvery time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. the user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, the corresponding object in Leaflet sends an event which you can access with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction. For example, let's add a function to the map that logs the latitude and longitude of the point on the map that the user clicks on.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\npoemMap.on('click', function(e) {\r\n    const latLng = e.latlng;\r\n    console.log(latLng.lat);\r\n    console.log(latLng.lng);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we add a function to the map that is called whenever the user clicks on the map. The `.on()` method takes two parameters: the event name and a function that is called when the event occurs. The event name is `click` and the function has a parameter `e`, which is the map click event object that is created.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks on the map, the `.on()` method calls the function we defined. We can access these coordinates by getting the `.latlng` (lowercase) property of the `e` object and then the `.lat` and `.lng` properties on the new `.latLng` object. (Note the differences between the new object we create--it has a capital `L` in the name.)\r\n\r\nIf you check your developer console in the browser, you should now see the latitude and longitude of the point on the map that the user clicks on.\r\n\r\nLeaflet has [very extensive documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) on all its methods, properties, and events that I recommend you look through. We'll discuss more strategies for using documentation in a coming lesson, but it's good to take a preliminary look.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1.

Push all your code to GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the following key terms?\r\n\r\n- modular programming\r\n- layers\r\n- markers\r\n- popups\r\n- events\r\n\r\n## Download the Project\r\n\r\nHere are the course files we created for this lesson if you need a reference:\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='11_index.html, 11_script.js, 11_styles.css, 11_poem.html, 11_poem.css, 11_poem.js, poem.json, 11_map.js'\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n# Working With GeoSpatial Data\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, we'll marshall our hard-earned skills with jQuery, JSON, and Leaflet to add a bit more complexity to our mapping project. We'll use a dataset of geospatial data to add some more interesting features to our maps. Specifically, we'll use a dataset that defines the locations of neighborhoods across New York City and incorporate it into our project.\r\n\r\nUsing this dataset will allow us to:\r\n- Add neighborhoods boundaries as a new layer to the map\r\n- Add popups to the neighborhood polygons\r\n- List all neighborhoods on the page and add buttons and links to pan to each neighborhood's location\r\n\r\nBecause we are combining all of the skills we've learned throughout this course, I recommend taking it slowly and carefully. Be sure to understand the concepts, syntax, and major moves of each part before moving on. \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, let's get started!\r\n\r\n## The Dataset\r\n\r\nWe have said that we'd like to use a dataset that defines the locations of neighborhoods across New York City. We'll talk about good ways to find datasets in the coming weeks (as you begin your own final projects), but for now, let's use the dataset [from this source](https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods/resource/35dd04fb-81b3-479b-a074-a27a37888ce7). If you click on the link, you can see a nice map of NYC that shows the boundaries of the neighborhoods. We'll do something similar with this dataset on our own maps.\r\n\r\nLet's use the dataset as a local file in our project folder. You can download it from the source website or simply use the download button below:\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='nycneighborhoods.json'\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\r\nYou'll see that we get a JSON file that contains the data we need. Make sure you save it in your working directory for this course. Let's open this file in VSCode and take a look at it:\r\n\r\n![NYC Dataset](/images/nyc-dataset.png)\r\n\r\nIt all looks a little confusing, doesn't it? Let's break down what we are seeing here.\r\n\r\nThe JSON file we have here is an example of __GeoJSON__. [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is a subset of JSON that defines a set of specifically _geographic_ features. In other words, it is a standardized format for representing spatial data and is used by many different mapping applications.\r\n\r\nJust like regular JSON files you have seen, GeoJSON files utilize key-value pairs to define the features.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice our dataset is of the _type_ `\"FeatureCollection\"`. This is a special type of JSON object that contains a list or collection of multiple features. Each feature is itself a JSON object that additionally has the key `\"type\"` with a value of `\"Feature\"`. Each feature has a number of properties that define the object. For instance, you can see that we have properties of `neighborhood`, `boroughCode`, `borough`, and `id`. Each of these has a value that we will be able to access and use later. Each feature also has a property called `geometry` that contains the coordinates of the feature (the neighborhood). Each feature is defined as a polygon with an array of coordinates that define the shape of the polygon (the neighborhood in question). Remember that spatial data can be points, lines, or polygons--we are dealing with polygons here because we are circumscribing the shape of each neighborhood. If you scroll through the file, you'll see that we have a feature for each of the neighborhoods in NYC. \r\n\r\nOkay, let's prepare our page so we can use the dataset.\r\n\r\n## Preparing the Page\r\n\r\nLet's create a few new files. First, create a new HTML file in your working directory called `nyc-data.html`. Go ahead and add the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n  \u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.css\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha512-hoalWLoI8r4UszCkZ5kL8vayOGVae1oxXe/2A4AO6J9+580uKHDO3JdHb7NzwwzK5xr/Fs0W40kiNHxM9vyTtQ==\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"\"/\u003e\r\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"nyc-data.css\"\u003e\r\n   \u003cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/leaflet.js\"\r\n   integrity=\"sha512-BB3hKbKWOc9Ez/TAwyWxNXeoV9c1v6FIeYiBieIWkpLjauysF18NzgR1MBNBXf8/KABdlkX68nAhlwcDFLGPCQ==\"\r\n   crossorigin=\"\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/head\u003e\r\n  \u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\r\n      \u003ch1\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n      \u003cdiv id=\"map\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"nyc-data.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n  \u003c/body\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should all be fairly familiar stuff to you. We get the necessary Leaflet and jQuery files, and we add a custom CSS file as well as a new JavaScript file to work with. To be able to navigate to the page, you can simply add another link to it in your `index.html` file, like we did with our poem:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"nyc-data.html\"\u003eNYC Neighborhoods\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, go ahead and create the new CSS file, `nyc-data.css`, and add the following:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n#map { \r\n    height: 600px; \r\n    width: 75%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will set the size of the map to be 75% of the width of the page and 600px tall.\r\n\r\nNext, create a new JavaScript file, `nyc-data.js`, and add the following to create the initial map:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nlet nycMap;\r\nnycMap = L.map(\"map\");\r\n\r\n// create tile layer\r\nL.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\r\n\tmaxZoom: 18,\r\n\tattribution: '\u0026copy; \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"\u003eOpenStreetMap\u003c/a\u003e contributors'\r\n}).addTo(nycMap);\r\n\r\nnycMap.setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 16);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck to make sure your map displays properly. If so, let's move on to the next step.\r\n\r\n## Adding the Data\r\n\r\nThere are several different ways we could add this data to our map, but perhaps the simplest way will be to use Leaflet's built-in `L.geoJSON` method. This function takes in a GeoJSON object and adds it to a map.\r\n\r\nTo use this method, however, we'll need to make a minor change to our `nycneighborhoods.json` file. In the file itself, we'll want to store the JSON object as a JavaScript variable we can work with.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we'll need to do is change the file type from `.json` to `.js`, as a JavaScript file. You can change the file extension easily by simply right-clicking the file in the Explorer Window and selecting Rename. Change the file name to `nycneighborhoods.js`.\r\n\r\nNow, in your `nycneighborhoods.js` file, create a new variable at the very top of the file to store the data like so:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst nyc = {\r\n\"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to work directly with the `nyc` variable to add the data to our map. This is the easiest way I've found to utilize the `L.geoJSON()` method to add data to a map without having to worry about taking extra steps to \"parse\" the data. Otherwise, Leaflet seems to have difficulty working directly with GeoJSON data, and you'll receive an `\"Invalid GeoJSON object\"` error. \r\n\r\nThere is, however, one more step to take. We'll need to include the dataset as a source in our HTML file. So, in the `\u003chead\u003e` of your `nyc-data.html` file, add the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cscript src=\"nycneighborhoods.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we can finally create a new Leaflet layer with the data and add it to our map. In your `nyc-data.js` file, add the following line of code:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nL.geoJSON(nyc).addTo(nycMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `nyc` variable we created earlier is the data in our dataset. We can use the `L.geoJSON` method to add this data to our map. If you save and check your page, you should now see the neighborhoods of NYC outlined over the map:\r\n\r\n![Nyc Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods1.png)\r\n\r\nPretty neat, right? Make sure you are seeing this correctly display before moving on.\r\n\r\n## Styling the Data\r\n\r\nLet's add a bit of fill color to the polygons to make them stand out:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// add some fill color to the map\r\nL.geoJSON(nyc, {\r\n    style: function(feature) {\r\n        return {\r\n            color: \"blue\",\r\n            fillColor: \"yellow\",\r\n            fillOpacity: 0.5\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}).addTo(nycMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `style` function takes in a `feature` (in this case, our neighborhood polygons) and returns a style object, which we add to our map. The style object here has three properties: `color`, `fillColor`, and `fillOpacity`. The `color` property sets the color of the polygon border, the `fillColor` property sets the color of the polygon interior, and the `fillOpacity` property sets the opacity of the polygon interior.\r\n\r\nYou should now see the polygons styled as a pale yellow with a blue border:\r\n\r\n![NYC Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods2.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Popups to the Data\r\n\r\nLet's add some popups to our map to show the name of each neighborhood. To do this, we'll need to add a new property to our object: `onEachFeature`. This property takes in a function that will be called for each feature (each neighborhood) in the dataset:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// show each borough on the map\r\nL.geoJSON(nyc, {\r\n    onEachFeature: function(feature, layer) {\r\n        layer.bindPopup(\"\u003ch3\u003e\" + feature.properties.borough + \"\u003c/h3\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003ch3\u003e\" + feature.properties.neighborhood + \"\u003c/h3\u003e\");\r\n    }\r\n}).addTo(nycMap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `onEachFeature` property takes in a function with two arguments: the feature and the layer. The feature is the neighborhood itself, and the layer is the Leaflet layer that will be added to the map. We can use the `bindPopup` method to add a popup to the layer. Using HTML in the popup, we can display the name of the neighborhood and the borough by getting the `properties` object from the feature and accessing the `borough` and `neighborhood` properties. In between the `\u003ch3\u003e` tags, we can put a horizontal rule `\u003chr\u003e` to separate the borough and neighborhood names. Finally, as always, we add the layer to the map.\r\n\r\nIf you save, you should now be able to click on each neighborhood to see a popup with the name of the neighborhood and the borough.\r\n\r\n![NYC Neighborhoods](/images/nyc-neighborhoods3.png)\r\n\r\nGreat! Now, let's add a bit more functionality to our page.\r\n\r\n## Adding Buttons\r\n\r\nLet's say we wanted to add a button to our page that pans the map to a particular neighborhood. Let's create a new button in our `nyc-data.html` file, below our map `\u003cdiv\u003e` tag:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cbutton id=\"pan-to-flatbush\"\u003ePan to Flatbush\u003c/button\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn our `nyc-data.js` file, we can then use jQuery to check for a click event on the button, and find the neighborhood in the dataset:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n$(\"#pan-to-flatbush\").click(function() {\r\n    // find flatbush neighborhood property in the dataset\r\n    let flatbush = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\r\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\r\n    });\r\n    console.log(flatbush);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use the `find` method to find the neighborhood in the dataset that matches the name we want to pan to. The `find` method takes in a function that will be called for each feature (each neighborhood) in the dataset. In this case, we want to find the neighborhood that matches the name \"Flatbush\". The `find` method will return the first neighborhood that matches the function. To see the result, we `console.log()` the neighborhood we find, just to make sure we are pulling in the correct data.\r\n\r\nIf you save and click the Flatbush button, you should see the feature object for Flatbush logged to the console:\r\n\r\n![Find Flatbush](/images/find_flatbush.png)\r\n\r\nPerfect, we have successfully found the neighborhood we want to pan to. Now, let's use the `panTo` method to pan the map to the neighborhood. Let's fill out this section of code to accomplish this:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// use jquery to see if flatbush button is clicked\r\n$(\"#pan-to-flatbush\").click(function() {\r\n    // find flatbush neighborhood property in the dataset\r\n    let flatbush = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\r\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\r\n    });\r\n    console.log(flatbush);\r\n    // find the coordinates of flatbush property\r\n    let coordinates = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\r\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === \"Flatbush\";\r\n    }).geometry.coordinates;\r\n    console.log(coordinates);\r\n    nycMap.panTo(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0]));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo pan the map to the neighborhood, we need to find the coordinates of the neighborhood. We can do this by accessing the `geometry` property from the feature and accessing the `coordinates` property. The `coordinates` property is an array of arrays, and we `console.log(coordinates)` to make sure we are pulling in the correct data. We then use the `panTo` method to pan the map to the coordinates.\r\n\r\nIf you save and click the Flatbush button, you should see the map pan to Flatbush. It's not perfect (it doesn't pan to the exact center, but to the outer border of the neighborhood), but it's pretty close. To pan exactly to the center of the polygon would require a bit more complex calculations on our part, but this will work for demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\n## Listing All Neighborhoods\r\n\r\nWe now have a simple external button control that allows us to pan the map to Flatbush. What if we wanted to list _all_ the neighborhoods of NYC and allow the user to click on each to pan to it? \r\n\r\nBelow our Flatbush button, let's add a new `\u003cdiv\u003e` for displaying the entire list of neighborhoods:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003cdiv id =\"neighborhoods\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, in our `nyc-data.js` file, we'll want to loop through the dataset objects, pulling out the neighborhood name from each so we can display it in the list.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// get a list of all the neighborhoods in the dataset\r\nlet neighborhoods = nyc.features.map(function(feature) {\r\n    return feature.properties.neighborhood;\r\n}).filter(function(neighborhood) {\r\n    return neighborhood !== \"\";\r\n}).sort();\r\nconsole.log(neighborhoods);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use the `map` method to loop through the dataset and return an array of neighborhood names. The `filter` method then allows us to remove any neighborhoods that are blank (in case there are blank property names in the dataset). We then use the `sort` method to sort the neighborhoods alphabetically. Finally, we `console.log()` the neighborhoods array to make sure we are pulling in the correct data.\r\n\r\nIf you check your console, you should see the list of sorted neighborhoods as output:\r\n\r\n![Neighborhoods List](/images/neighborhoods_list.png)\r\n\r\nLet's go ahead and write these out to our neighborhoods `\u003cdiv\u003e`:\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\n// display all the neighborhoods in the neighborhoods div\r\nneighborhoods.forEach(function(neighborhood) {\r\n    $(\"#neighborhoods\").append(\"\u003ca href ='#'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\" + neighborhood + \"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\");\r\n    // display in columns\r\n    if (neighborhoods.indexOf(neighborhood) % 4 === 0) {\r\n        $(\"#neighborhoods\").append(\"\u003cbr\u003e\");\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we utilize the `forEach` method to loop through the neighborhoods array and `append` each neighborhood to the `\u003cdiv\u003e` with the id of `neighborhoods`. As you may recall from [an earlier lesson's Challenge #3](?page=10), `forEach` is similar to `map()`, with the important difference being that `forEach` does not create a new array (which would be unnecessary in this case). You'll notice that we are surrounding each neighborhood with an `\u003ca href\u003e` tag and a `\u003cli\u003e` (list item) tag. This is because we want to be able to turn each name into a clickable element. We can use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the neighborhood in the array. If the index is divisible by 4, we add a `\u003cbr\u003e` tag to separate the neighborhoods into spaced columns to make things a little easier to read.\r\n\r\nTo enable a basic columnar structure, we also need to add a line of code to our `nyc-data.css` file:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n#neighborhoods {\r\n    columns: 100px 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to create a simple columnar structure with 3 columns, each 100px wide.\r\n\r\nIf you save all files and check your page, you should see the list of neighborhoods displayed in columns:\r\n\r\n![Neighborhoods List](/images/neighborhoods_list_columns.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that there are several duplicates in the dataset (e.g., Jamaica Bay, Broad Islands, Pelham Islands, etc.), and that we are not always getting groups of 4. The data probably needs to be cleaned up (in this case, removing redundancies), which is always a good idea when working with data in your actual projects. We won't worry about this for now.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we now have a full list of clickable elements. Finally, let's add a click event to each neighborhood to pan the map to that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// if the neighborhood is clicked, find the neighborhood on the map and pan to it\r\n$(\"#neighborhoods\").on(\"click\", \"li\", function() {\r\n    let neighborhoodText = $(this).text(); // get the text of the neighborhood\r\n    let coordinates = nyc.features.find(function(feature) {\r\n        return feature.properties.neighborhood === neighborhoodText; //check if the text matches the neighborhood in the dataset\r\n    }).geometry.coordinates; // get the coordinates of the neighborhood\r\n    nycMap.panTo(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0]));\r\n    // zoom in\r\n    nycMap.setZoom(16);\r\n    // add a marker to the neighborhood polygon\r\n    L.marker(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0])).addTo(nycMap);\r\n    // add a popup to the marker\r\n    L.marker(new L.LatLng(coordinates[0][0][1], coordinates[0][0][0])).bindPopup(\"\u003ch3\u003e\" + neighborhoodText + \"\u003c/h3\u003e\").addTo(nycMap);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use the `.on(click)` method to add a click event to the `\u003cli\u003e` tag (i.e., each neighborhood name). We then use the `$(this).text` method to get the text of the particular `\u003cli\u003e` tag that was clicked. Remember, in this context, `this` simply points to whatever element is being acted upon. It is flexible in that we don't have to specify an individual element of the type. Next, we check if the `neighborhoodText` matches the `neighborhood` property in the dataset. If it does, we can use the `find` method to find the neighborhood in the dataset and grab the coordinates. Using the coordinates, we `panTo` the location. We also zoom in on the neighborhood and add a marker with a popup to the spot.\r\n\r\nIf you save your page, you should now be able to click on each neighborhood and the map will automatically zoom toward the neighborhood in question. Cool!\r\n\r\nAgain, you'll notice we are not displaying the marker in the exact center of the neighborhood polygon. Because each polygon is differently shaped and built-up from a large variety of coordinates, we'll just place the marker at the border of the neighborhood like we did before. Figuring out how to center each marker would probably be an important task if we were planning to use this website professionally, however.\r\n\r\nThe last step we should probably take is to give attribution to our dataset source. Even if the source is open and freely available for use, it's wise to give attribution in case there are mistakes or otherwise undesirable elements in the data. This is not only a way to protect yourself, but also to let others know where to find/work with your data themselves.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, we can simply provide a link to the source at the top of our page, by adding a link below our header:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\u003ca href = \"https://data.beta.nyc/dataset/pediacities-nyc-neighborhoods/resource/35dd04fb-81b3-479b-a074-a27a37888ce7\" alt=\"Data Source\"\u003eHere's the source for NYC neighborhood boundaries.\u003c/a\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What Have We Done?\r\n\r\nLet's take a moment to review the variety of skills and techniques we've utilized to create this new page. Although the page is fairly simple looking, we've accomplished some rather complex tasks. We have:\r\n\r\n- A base layer map of the world\r\n- An overlay of neighborhoods in NYC specifically, using a geospatial dataset\r\n- The ability to click around on the map and see each neighborhood\r\n- An external button that allows us to navigate to a particular location on the map, based on the data we have\r\n- An entire list of clickable neighborhoods pulled from the dataset\r\n\r\nWe are only scratching the surface of what jQuery, JSON, and Leaflet can do working in tandem, but we have accomplished quite a lot. These are the skills we'll employ to put together your own final projects with your own datasets, your own stylistic creativity, and your own intentions for the final result.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1. Each object in a GeoJSON dataset is called a:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Property\r\n- Feature* \r\n- Coordinate\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. True or False - The `geometry` property contains coordinate data for a particular feature.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True*\r\n- False\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n3. When using a dataset pulled from an online source, it is wise to: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Check the data for redundancies, duplicates, or otherwise erroneous material*\r\n- `console.log()` your retrievals of the data for testing purposes*\r\n- Give attribution for your source*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Create another button that pans the map to your favorite neighborhood.\r\n\r\n2. Draw some polylines to connect the boundaries of different neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n3. If a neighborhood is in Manhattan, change the color of the neighborhood polygons to red. (Hint: You'll need to check for the `borough` property and perform `style` changes accordingly.)\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\nDo you recall the meaning of the following terms?\r\n\r\n- GeoJSON\r\n- FeatureCollections/Features\r\n- Geometry\r\n\r\n## Download the Project\r\n\r\nHere are the course files we created for this lesson if you need a reference:\r\n\r\n\u003cDownload files='12_index.html, 12_script.js, 12_styles.css, 12_poem.html, 12_poem.css, 12_poem.js, poem.json, 12_map.js, 12_nyc-data.css, 12_nyc-data.html, 12_nyc-data.js, nycneighborhoods.js'\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n# Reading Documentation\r\n\r\nThroughout this course, we have often referred you to \"the documentation\" for various libraries and tools. As you may have experienced when looking through these resources, documentation can be overwhelmingly large, complex, and confusing. Learning to read documentation is an important skill, but it's one that takes time.\r\n\r\nSo, in this lesson, we'll look to some strategies to help you:\r\n1. Better navigate through technical jargon.\r\n2. Better understand the structure and style of documentation.\r\n3. Feel more confident in your ability to read documentation overall.\r\n\r\n## What is Documentation?\r\n\r\nDocumentation, at its core, is a collection of descriptions/explanations for employing a particular product or service. Unfortunately, documentation can run the gamut from being very thorough to very vague. Oftentimes, the more niche a product is, and the smaller the community, the less in-depth the documentation. \r\n\r\nThis is also, partly, due to the nature of documentation's audience. If documentation is too overly thorough in its explanations, experienced developers might find it bloated. On the other hand, if documentation is too sparse, new developers might find it difficult to understand. Writing efficient documentation means hitting the sweet spot between thoroughness, understandability, and ease of use.\r\n\r\n## \"Getting Started\" vs. \"Documentation\"\r\n\r\nMost documentation for a tool has two separate sections, written from different perspectives.\r\n\r\n1. \"Getting Started\" is a section that describes how to get started using the tool. It is meant to be a quick introduction for how to install, configure, and use the product in a basic way. Leaflet's [\"Quick Start\" guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) is a good example of this, with basic comprehension and implementation instructions.\r\n2. Compare, now, Leaflet's Quick Start to [Leaflet's full docs](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html). This is more like a dictionary or glossary of presets, methods, and actions. Information density is prioritized rather than presenting a readable tutorial you can follow along with directly.\r\n\r\n## The Art of ~~Reading~~ Referencing\r\n\r\nFor the most part, documentation isn't meant to be \"read\" in the traditional sense. Rather, it is meant to be _referenced_. If you have a sense of the overall structure, you can usually jump through non-chronologically. Using \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e to maneuver through search terms is often the best approach.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the [CSS reference docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). It is, in short, overwhelming. It contains the full list of CSS properties and values, as well as a lot of information about them. However, if we want to achieve something simple, such as changing the font properties of a particular piece of text, we can simply \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e `font` to find all the relevant properties:\r\n\r\n![MDN font](/images/mdn-font.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a good example of how documentation works. The baseline property, in this case, `font`, is our first highlighted result. Everything else is in some sense a derivative of the baseline property; for instance, we can specify directly the font size, the weight, the [kerning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-kerning), etc. \r\n\r\nIn general, when searching for terms, first look to the most basic (i.e., probably the least wordy and jargony) instance. It will likely provide you with the foundational concept of the language that you're looking for and let you expand upon it.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of reference docs for the tools we are using in this course. Spend a little bit of time looking at each one, discerning its structure and how you can best use it. Search around for some terms and click/scroll around to see what comes up.\r\n\r\n- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)\r\n- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)\r\n- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)\r\n- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)\r\n- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)\r\n- [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)\r\n\r\nThe MDN reference docs are usually the most comprehensive, and besides searching for terms you can also use the sidebar to navigate through additional resources. This is also the case with the Leaflet and jQuery docs.\r\n\r\nIf you ever find yourself without internet and need offline documentation, one useful tool is [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/), an offline documentation browser. It contains most (although not all) of the docsets for the tools and languages that we've used in this course so far.\r\n\r\n## Beyond the Docs\r\n\r\n### Google Searches\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons why learning with official documentation is the best approach for really coming to grips with a language. However, we may have inflated this a little. While documentation is best utilized when you have a very specific end goal, and when you already have a basic sense of how this goal might be accomplished, these factors may not always be in place. Especially when you are first starting out with a language or tool, you may not know the best search parameters to use in docs. \r\n\r\nIf you aren't quite sure what you are looking for (and \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e isn't being helpful), simply Googling around is the best way to go when faced with a particular problem. There are, however, some best practices for this as well. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you created a button on a page, and you wanted to add some space around it so other elements aren't cramming it. How would you go about doing this? What sort of keywords would you use? What language is suitable?\r\n\r\nProgramming isn't always that different from other software contexts you have encountered. Thinking about the typical Word or Google doc you might write, when thinking about space around something you are probably dealing with `margins` in some form. Aside from \u003ckbd\u003ectrl\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ef\u003c/kbd\u003e `margin` in the docs, you could also turn to Google. In this case your search parameters could be something like: \"adding margins around a button css\", or even simply, \"adding space around a button css.\" Note that although Google will likely figure it out, we are explicitly searching here for CSS. Specifying the language is important, as it will help us narrow down our search results.\r\n\r\n### Handling Errors\r\n\r\nWe have talked about the basics of understanding errors before, but its worth noting that documentation often provides info on how to deal with possible errors that may arise in a program. There may be errors that can arise that are specific to the tool, and the docs can be the best place to go when dealing with these issues. However, this may not always be the case. If the docs are less than clear, again, simply Googling a confusing error message can be a useful approach if it has you stumped. This is not necessarily to say you should simply copy/paste an entire error. For example, copy/pasting this behemoth of an error message...\r\n    \r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: _super.call is not a function\r\n    at new ObservableQuery (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:26213)\r\n    at QueryManager.watchQuery (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27305)\r\n    at b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27332\r\n    at new Promise (\u003canonymous\u003e)\r\n    at QueryManager.query (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27330)\r\n    at ApolloClient.query (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:27981)\r\n    at Object.require.2.react (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:29740)\r\n    at newRequire (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:41)\r\n    at require.39 (b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:66)\r\n    at b1f6a7d9f98d979758232d0dc3c394ce.js:71\r\n```\r\n\r\n... would not give you very good results. A solution might be to:\r\n\r\n1. First, articulate your code that's breaking into a series of smaller steps. Often, programmers recommend a method called [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). This is a technique similar to writing pseudo-code, in that you first try to articulate your problem in spoken or written natural language. Attempting to explain the problem in simple language will very often lead you to a solution, or the beginning of a solution. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. \r\n\r\n2. Second, begin your search. Hopefully you now have a rough idea of what your code is and isn't doing correctly, so begin by including keywords from your error message and try to find results that fit your particular use case. For example, in the error above, if you Google \"javascript uncaught (in promise) typeerror\", you will find quite a few people have run into the same problem!\r\n\r\nThe first hit of this result is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57673148/how-to-fix-uncaught-in-promise-typeerror-cannot-read-property-method-of-un) question on the notorious Stack Overflow. Its worth taking a minute to discuss this site.\r\n\r\n![Stack Overflow](/images/error_google.png)\r\n\r\n### Stack Overflow\r\n\r\nStack Overflow is a very commonly used resource for programmers. It is a great place to find answers to all kinds of questions, and even to share your knowledge with others if you feel up to it. It is essentially a question/answer forum, and, at this point, contains over 21 million programming questions. If you have a question or issue about your code, it is very likely someone else has had it too. Whether or not you will always find an answer to your problem is more dubious, but it can be informational in other ways as well.  \r\n\r\nLet's say we wanted to figure out how to disable a button using jQuery (for instance, a \"submit\" button that only works when a form is filled out on the page). We could search for \"disable button jquery\" in Google. The first hit of this result is not actually pointing us to documentation, but rather to [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1594952/jquery-disable-enable-submit-button/62723465#62723465).\r\n\r\n![Stack Overflow](/images/stack_overflow_example.png)\r\n\r\nAlways, take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down through the answers and the discussions to find what you're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates—another \"feature\" of Stack Overflow. (Unfortunately, in many cases this is why I wouldn't recommend _asking_ questions as a beginner on StackOverflow, as folks and moderators can be less than friendly. It is still a great place for _finding_ answers through search, however). In this particular case, there are many, many answers, and almost each one is a different way to solve the problem. It is worth pointing out that this question was asked over 12 years ago, which is something you might want to consider, as some things may possibly be out of date. In any case, there is a plethora of information on the page that should help point you in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, implementing code snippets from Stack Overflow is an incredibly common practice, and is even the source of many jokes, like this meme:\r\n\r\n![Joke](/images/so_joke.jpg)\r\n\r\nDon't feel the need to reinvent the wheel if you find a working solution on Stack Overflow. However, do pay close attention to any code you wrangle with, and make sure you understand what it is doing and how it fits into your overall program/project.\r\n\r\n### Other Resources\r\n\r\nWhile Stack Overflow is a great resource for programmers, it is not the only resource. There are many, many others, like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/), different subreddits (like r/webdev, r/learnjavascript, etc.) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and much more. I would especially recommend reddit, as the communities are very active and usually inviting of folks who are just learning to code.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to go really in-depth learning Leaflet, I would highly recommend Malcom Maclean's [Leaflet Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/leaflet-tips-and-tricks/read).\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nIn general, keep in mind that documentation is best used as a reference for what you can do with a particular piece of software. It is not always the best place to start for beginners, but you will likely always end up arriving at the official documentation in one way or another. Beyond that, simply Googling around can be a good jumping off point. The absolute most important thing to learn is how to find answers to your questions. This means learning how to ask the _right_ questions. As a recap, when searching, be sure to:\r\n1. Include the language/tool you are searching in as a search parameter.\r\n2. Break down your search into keywords.\r\n3. Be specific.\r\n4. Don't be afraid to copy/paste and tweak results to fit your programs, but be sure to understand what the code is doing as best you can.\r\n\r\nAs you begin putting together your final project in the remaining weeks, try to keep these resources and strategies in mind, and refer back to them as needed.\r\n\r\n## Review Questions\r\n\r\n1. You should read documentation straight through, from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True\r\n- False*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n2. You should copy and paste your entire error message when searching for guidance through Google.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- True\r\n- False*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n3. To get the most out of your Google searches, you should: (select all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Include the target language/tool you are searching in as a search parameter.*\r\n- Break down your search into keywords.*\r\n- Be specific.*\r\n- Say please.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\nHere's a basic rectangle class in HTML:   \r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"rectangle\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cp\u003eI am a rectangle\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Using this [CSS reference guide](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/), look into how you might do the following: \r\n    1. Give the rectangle a width, height, and background color.\r\n    2. Give the box a thick border.\r\n    3. Center the rectangle on the page.\r\n    4. Center the \"I am a rectangle\" text within the rectangle.\r\n    5. Add a drop shadow to the rectangle.\r\n\r\n2. Using the [jQuery reference](https://api.jquery.com/), look into how you might do the following:\r\n    1. Check if the user has pressed the \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e key on the keyboard.\r\n    2. Add a hover event to an element (like a button) so that it will change color when the mouse is hovering over it.\r\n    3. Scroll to the top of the page if the user clicks a button.\r\n\r\n3. Using the [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) and/or Google, look into how you might do the following:\r\n    1. Find the index of a substring within a string (like \"dog\" in \"The dog jumped.\").\r\n    2. Given an array of numbers (e.g., `[40, 38, 37, 93, 55, 66]`, filter out any values that are less than 50.\r\n    3. Given a decimal number (like `.36`), round it up to the nearest whole number.\r\n    4. Create a random number between 1 and 100.\r\n\r\n## Key Terms\r\n\r\n- Documentation\r\n- Reference\r\n- Rubber Duck Debugging \r\n\r\n# Starting Your Project \r\n\r\nCongratulations on making it this far! We've covered quite a lot of ground in a rather short amount of time. At this point, you should be well-equipped to get your hands dirty starting your own projects. \r\n\r\nThat being the case, the remaining few weeks will be entirely devoted to working on your own projects. Your projects will largely be self-directed, based on your own particular creative aspirations or research interests. There are, however, a few requirements. Let's go through them.\r\n\r\n## Project Requirements\r\n\r\nYour projects should demonstrate that you understand the major concepts covered in this course. At a baseline level, this means your project should include:\r\n\r\n- A homepage that includes a brief description of your project and its purpose.\r\n- Interactive content that allows the user to explore the project (buttons, links, images, text, etc).\r\n- Dataset(s) pertinent to the project, whether it be data you've created yourself, or data you've imported from a data source.\r\n- Some sort of visualization of the data you are working with (e.g., a map).\r\n- A style appropriate to the project or to your personal aesthetic tastes.\r\n- A new GitHub repository dedicated to the project and a working version that you can share with others.\r\n\r\nDepending on the kind of project you are creating, it might be weighted towards one or more of these requirements over the others. This is fine, as long as you are, again, able to show that you understand the material we've covered.\r\n\r\n## Project Components\r\n\r\nThe above requirements will expect you to demonstrate knowledge with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JSON, Leaflet, and GitHub. In other words, in practical terms your project will be comprised of _at least_ one of each of the following:\r\n\r\n- HTML file\r\n- CSS file\r\n- JavaScript file\r\n- JSON file\r\n- Leaflet map\r\n- GitHub repository\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that all of these components are meant to _work together_ to tell a particular story or demonstrate a particular idea or purpose.\r\n\r\nIt will be up to you to decide how you want to structure your project. Will it be comprised of multiple web pages? Will it be a single web page with multiple components? The design will probably depend on your own creative ideas, the kind of project you are developing, and your ultimate goals for the user of the site. We'll talk through some strategies for putting your site together next week, but it will be helpful to have some idea of how you might structure your project before you begin writing any code.\r\n\r\n## Project Ideas\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, your projects are self-directed and individually tailored. The content and structure of your site can be based on whatever you'd like. However, let's discuss some ideas to help you get off the ground.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point for your projects, ask yourself: \r\n\r\n1. What kind of story do I want to tell?\r\n2. What kind of data will I need?\r\n3. What kind of visualizations will I want?\r\n4. How will the website be structured?\r\n5. How will the user interact with the website?\r\n\r\nHere are some sample ideas for projects:\r\n\r\n- An exploration of an essay, poem, or work of fiction\r\n- A Choose Your Own Adventure game\r\n- A walking tour of the city\r\n- An exploration of green spaces, parks, wildlife, etc.\r\n- An exploration of libraries, archives, or museums\r\n- Observations/celebrations of ethnic or cultural diversity\r\n- Observations on geography and political affiliations, income levels, access to healthcare, etc.\r\n- An investigation of the impacts of climate change\r\n\r\nThese are just suggestions, but feel free to use them as a starting point. For example, let's say you wanted to create a walking tour. What might your site consist of? A few things off the top of my head could be:\r\n\r\n- Polylines indicating the tour on a map\r\n- A dataset with coordinates of the walk and interesting features along the way\r\n- Markers and popups giving information on the map\r\n- Images to show some of the views of the walk\r\n- Text to describe the walk\r\n- Links to landmarks, businesses (restaurants, bars, cafes) etc. along the way\r\n\r\nThese are just basic elements that could be the foundation of an interesting guided tour. Feel free to get creative and expand on your ideas to make something particularly unique!\r\n\r\n## Project Scope\r\n\r\nIt is very important to keep in mind that there are only a few weeks remaining in the semester. While it is fine to have big ideas and plans for your project, be very mindful of the __scope__ of your project and what you can actually accomplish in the allotted time. In other words, try to narrow down your project to a _single achievable goal_. Creating big, complex, beautiful websites takes a lot of time and effort, and is not necessarily the point of this project. \r\n\r\nInstead, try to provide major milestones for yourself to work towards that comprise the essential parts of your project. Keep your project goals direct, to the point, and attuned to the project requirements. You can always build upon your work later, but don't get bogged down in too much detail or minor features until you have a sufficient working version of the site.\r\n\r\n## Where to Find Data?\r\n\r\nOkay, now that we've discussed some of the basics for your project, let's look to some ways to gather data. Depending on your project, you might be gathering/creating your dataset yourself, or you might be importing data from a source online. For the latter option, here are a few recommendations for finding datasets:\r\n\r\n- [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/): Official source for data in New York City.\r\n- [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://www.usgs.gov/): Official source for geological data in the United States.\r\n- [Google's Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): Search for datasets on Google.\r\n- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Search for a variety of datasets on Kaggle.\r\n- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): US Gov data covering everything from climate change to crime.\r\n- [Datahub.io](https://datahub.io/): Mostly business and finance datasets\r\n- [EarthData](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/): NASA data\r\n- [Data.world](https://data.world/): Data from various sources\r\n\r\n### Use JSON Data\r\n\r\nEach of these websites has a search engine that can help you find datasets that you might be interested in. In general, keep in mind that __we want to use JSON files__. Some sites will give you an option of multiple formats. If not, you may want to convert the data into JSON. For instance, if you encounter CSV files (which is common), you can use the [CSVtoJSON](https://csv.keyangxiang.com/) tool to convert the data into JSON. There are many online converters out there, so don't be discouraged if your data is not in a format you want.\r\n\r\nOkay, enough prepping. Let's get started! Attempt the Challenges below to get going with your ideas. __Above all, remember to have fun with your projects!__\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. Write a short project proposal to share your ideas with the class (a paragraph or two will suffice).\r\n\r\n2. Begin gathering or creating a dataset relevant to your ideas.\r\n\r\n3. Create a new folder and a new GitHub repository for the project. Begin uploading your essential files you'll be working with (an HTML file, a CSS file, a JS file, your data, etc.). If you need a refresher with GitHub, review the [GitHub lesson](?page=7).\r\n\r\n# Putting the Project Together\r\n\r\nHopefully you have a good idea of what you'd like your project to achieve. While there is no one right answer for how to structure your project, there are some best practices that you can employ to help you envision the final product. In this lesson, we'll cover a few strategies for thinking about your project holistically.\r\n\r\n## Wireframing\r\n\r\n__Wireframing__ is the practice of creating a rough outline of a project in order to help you visualize the final product. It usually involves drawing a basic sketch of what the project will look like and figuring out minor details later on. This helps determine how the information is presented and how the various bits of information interact. Because this entanglement of information is the center of wireframing, there is no focus on fonts or colors or graphics. For instance, here's a basic wireframe for YouTube culled from [this site](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/learning/handbooks/agile-handbook/wireframe.jsp):\r\n\r\n![Wireframe](/images/wireframe_example.png)\r\n\r\nIf you've ever used modern-day YouTube, this should look pretty familiar to you. It highlights only the essential aspects of what the site is meant to accomplish and what the user experience should be. Again, the point of wireframing is to help you visualize the final product; in other words, it serves as a blueprint for design. For your project, it can help you plan out:\r\n\r\n- __Content:__ What content will be displayed?\r\n- __Structure:__ How are the pieces of the application fitting together?\r\n- __Information Hierarchy:__ How is the information organized and displayed together? What is most important?\r\n- __Functionality:__ How will the overall interface work?\r\n- __Behavior:__ How will the users interact with the interface? What will be the results?\r\n\r\nTry grabbing a notebook or using [this site](https://app.diagrams.net/) to draw a simple wireframe plan for your project.\r\n\r\n## CSS Styling\r\n\r\n### Flexbox Layout\r\n\r\nRemember flexboxes? We used them to center and space our jokes page to make them look nice and to allow it to display well on mobile devices. They are not required for you to use in your projects, but they will likely come in handy in allowing you to effectively structure the content of your pages. For instance, we could have used them style our columns of NYC neighborhoods we created earlier to make the page much cleaner looking.\r\n\r\nIf you need a refresher on flexboxes, feel free to review [the lesson on CSS](?page=8) or look through the very handy [flexbox guide here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).\r\n\r\nIt's worth pointing out that flexboxes are similar to CSS `grids`. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, one might be better suited for your purposes than the other. I'd encourage you to [look over this resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout) and especially [this resource](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/flexbox-vs-css-grid-which-should-you-use--cms-30184) to learn about the differences between `grid` and `flexbox`, and to decide which might be best for your project.\r\n\r\n### Styling Elements\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that basically anything you display on the page can be styled. You can style the entire page, individual elements, or even individual parts of elements. For instance, let's say we wanted to add a bit of style to our \"Flatbush\" button from our map page we created in previous lessons. We want it to change color when the mouse hovers over it, and change color again once it's clicked. To accomplish this, we could use jQuery and CSS like so:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// change the color of the button when the mouse hovers over it and when it is clicked\r\n$(\"#flatbush\").mouseover(function() {\r\n    $(\"#flatbush\").css(\"background-color\", \"orange\");\r\n}).mouseout(function() {\r\n    $(\"#flatbush\").css(\"background-color\", \"white\");\r\n}).click(function() {\r\n    $(\"#flatbush\").css(\"background-color\", \"yellow\");\r\n}\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mouseover` and `mouseout` are jQuery events that are triggered when the mouse enters or leaves the element. The button's normal state is colored white, but when the mouse hovers over it, it changes color to orange. When the mouse is clicked, the button changes color to yellow.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could accomplish this entirely in CSS (without needing jQuery) to style the button when the mouse hovers over it and when it is clicked:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n#flatbush {\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n    border: 1px solid black;\r\n    padding: 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#flatbush:hover {\r\n    background-color: orange;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#flatbush:active {\r\n    background-color: yellow;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above CSS code will change the button's background color to orange when the mouse hovers over it, and to yellow when it is clicked. This latter option is probably the most appropriate way to go, as it is usually best to keep style changes to your CSS files if possible, but both options are available to you. There is almost always more than one way to accomplish a particular task.\r\n\r\nThese are very simple examples meant to get you thinking about the overall design of your page, and how you can make individual elements more perceptible and visually appealing. Remember, for accessibility purposes, you should try to provide a solid contrast with the colors you are using, especially if you are styling text.\r\n\r\n## Incorporating GeoJSON Data\r\n\r\nIf you have a GeoJSON dataset you'd like to work with, keep in mind the preliminary step we covered in the [Working With GeoSpatial Data](?page=12) lesson. If you recall, we first needed to convert the file to a JavaScript object, by changing the file extension to `.js` and then storing the data in a variable:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst varToStoreData = { // store all the data in a const variable\r\n\"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest way to utilize the `L.geoJSON()` method to add data to a map without having to worry about taking extra steps to \"parse\" the data. Otherwise, Leaflet seems to have difficulty working directly with JSON data. Once this is done, also remember that you need to include the new `.js` file in your HTML file's `\u003chead\u003e`:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n\u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"your_dataset.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method should work well in most cases.\r\n\r\n## General Advice\r\n\r\nIn general, while working on your projects, keep the following in mind:\r\n\r\n- __Don't be afraid to ask for help__. If you need help, you can always reach out to your instructor or to your fellow classmates. Even for solo projects, programming is almost always a collaborative venture (whether in drawing advice from colleagues, friends, or complete strangers online).\r\n- __Break down your project into smaller steps__. This will help you to better understand the overall purpose of your project and allow you to better understand the steps you need to take to complete it.\r\n- __Break your code itself down into logical chunks__. This is especially important for large projects, as it helps you keep your code organized and focused on the task at hand.\r\n- __Review previous lessons, check documentation, and search the web for resources__. This will help you to better understand the concepts you are employing and to better understand the code you are writing.\r\n- __Limit your scope__. Focus on the basics of building your site first, and worry about the complex aspects later.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nYour only challenge here is to continue working on your projects. __Good luck!__\r\n\r\n# Going Live\r\n\r\nThe last step in building your project is to go live with your project, or to deploy it to the web. This is, of course, the final step in the process of building a web application. Thankfully, GitHub has a built-in deployment tool that will allow you to deploy your project very easily.\r\n\r\n### Deploying to the Web\r\n\r\nOnce you are finished with your project, follow the instructions below to deploy your project to the web.\r\n\r\n1. __Stage, commit, and push all your changes to GitHub.__ Once you are finished working on your project, make sure to push all your changes to GitHub. \r\n\r\n2. __Navigate to your GitHub repository in your browser__. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub and click through to your project repository.\r\n\r\n3. __Go to the Settings tab at the top, and then to the Pages tab in the sidebar__.\r\n\r\n4. __Under Branch, choose `master`__.\r\n\r\n5. __Click the Save button__.\r\n\r\n6. __Refresh the page, or click on the Pages tab again__. You should see a new message saying \"Your site is live at...\". This will include your username, repository name, and the URL of your site.\r\n\r\n7. __Click Visit Site to view your published site__.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! You should now be able to see your site live on the web and be able to share it with others. For instance, here is my URL of the practice site we built together in this course: https://zipper3030.github.io/Javascript/\r\n\r\n__Congratulations on all your work!__ You have accomplished quite a lot in this course and had to overcome many difficult challenges along the way. I hope the course has inspired you to continue to improve your skills and knowledge with programming and web development. Good luck with your future endeavors!","title":"Intro to Javascript","description":"This is a basic introduction to JavaScript, which is the programming language of the web.

This first part of the workshop is a very quick overview of mapping concepts to help orient you to the process of mapmaking.\r\n\r\n![An example of a Points, Lines, and Polygon Map](/images/mapping/pointslinespolygonsmap.png)\r\n\r\nIn this map of the United States we see three basic shapes—the cities are represented by points, the main rivers are represented by lines and the states are represented by polygons. While this is a very simple map, most maps that you've seen, even the most intricate ones only consist of these three basic shapes—points, lines and polygons. This type of mapping data is called \"vector data.\" Vector data can be stored in several file formats with the most common being a \"[shapefile](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/shapefile.md).\"\r\n\r\n## Features and Attributes\r\n\r\nAnother mapping concept that's important to know is that the visualizations that are displayed on the map are called the map's \"[features](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/feature.md)\" and the data that's connected to those shapes are called the maps \"[attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute-table.md).\" Attribute data is stored in an attribute table, which is a lot like spreadsheet. One feature on the map can contain many attributes—the feature for the state of Florida has the attributes `STATEFP` (the state ID), `STUSPS` (the state abbreviation), `NAME` (the state name), etc. Any type of data that you have at the scale of the state can be put in this attribute table. The attribute table stores all of the data and then you decide what data you want to visualize.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot explaining the concepts features and attributes in mapping](/images/mapping/featuresattributes.png)\r\n\r\n## Sidebar: Raster Data\r\n\r\nThere is another important type of data that we will not be using in this workshop, but you should be aware of. It's called \"raster data.\" Raster data is an image, such as a satellite image, with \"geolocations\"—which just means location data. It's beneficial to store geographic data as raster data when you are working with continuous data, such as heat or elevation.\u003c!-- TODO #12: add \"raster data\" to glossary --\u003e\r\n\r\nTODO: clarify what these images are showing\r\n\r\n![An example of a Polygon Map](/images/mapping/polygonsmap.png)\r\n\r\n![An example of a Line Map](/images/mapping/polygonslinesmap.png)\r\n\r\n![An example of a Points, Lines, and Polygon Map](/images/mapping/pointslinespolygonsmap.png)\r\n\r\nVoilà!\r\n\r\nTODO: Have a section on vector data--there is a quiz about it but no explanation\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nVector data consists of? (check all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- points*\r\n- pixels\r\n- lines*\r\n- polygons*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Vector](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/vector.md)\r\n- [Raster](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/raster.md)\r\n- [Shapefile](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/shapefile.md)\r\n- [Features](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/feature.md)\r\n- [Attributes](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attribute-table.md)\r\n\r\n# Mapping Tools\r\n\r\nThere are a few questions to consider that will help you choose the right tool for mapping:\r\n\r\n- **Static or Interactive?** Do you want a static map, such as a high quality image that can be published? Or do you want an interactive web-based map?\r\n- **What is your budget?** Can you only rely on free tools or do you have some money to put towards your mapping project?\r\n- **What is your time commitment?** Do you have the time to learn higher level mapping skills, which is better for doing a spatial analysis, or do you want a tool that can allow you to make a map quickly because you just want to visualize spatial data?\r\n- **Will you be working in a team?** Might you need a shared platform for creating your map?\r\n\r\nBoth ArcGIS and QGIS are software that you download onto your computer and can be used to perform spatial operations (analyze and manipulate your data), and make composite maps. Here is a quick comparison of the two.\r\n\r\n![Chart that compares ARCGIS and QGIS](/images/mapping/toolscomparison.png)\r\n\r\nFor this workshop we will be using QGIS to perform spatial operations on our data. This is because QGIS is free and open source! However, since QGIS doesn't offer a way to make interactive maps, we will need a separate tool for that. ArcGIS does offer an online version that can be used to make interactive maps, but the limitation is that you need a paid subscription if you want to perform spatial operations. So for this workshop we're going to do a little hack in which we use two different mapping tools so we can have a completely free experience :) We will use QGIS to perform spatial operations. And then we will export the data and upload it into ArcGIS Online to make our interactive map.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick comparison for some of the mapping software that you can use to make an interactive map.\r\n\r\n![Chart that compares interactive map tools](/images/mapping/toolscomparison2.png)\r\n\r\nThe only option that is truly free is Leaflet, but it requires familiarity with coding. You can read more about the benefits and limitations of these tools in the blog post [\"Finding the Right Tools for Mapping\"](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/06/03/finding-the-right-tools-for-mapping/) on the Graduate Center's Digital Fellows blog.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\nA friend looks over your shoulder as you are going through the workshop. They ask, \"Why are you using two different mapping softwares?\" How would you respond?\r\n\r\n# Ethics of Mapping\r\n\r\n![Quote: \"Maps are embedded within power relations and mediate those relations through spatial representations — Pavlovskaya, M.E. (2006)\"](/images/mapping/quote1.png)\r\n\r\nIn introduction to mapping courses we are often told that every map starts with a lie—that the earth is flat. From the first step of having to choose a mapping projection and decide on which types of inaccuracies you would be willing to sacrifice, the process of mapping is filled with ethical choices. Over the years, many of these decisions have been obscured through a greater reliance on technology. Today, (far too many) mapmakers allow the software to make decisions for them. However, whether these are active or passive decisions, they are still decisions that affect the map and the viewers interpretation of the map.\r\n\r\n![Image providing examples of ways that maps can be projected from the earth's round surface onto a two-dimensional surface](/images/mapping/mapprojections.png)\r\n\r\nMaps are powerful. The cartesian map which divides the world into coordinates has its origins as being a tool for nation-state building and colonialism. Due to this history, maps are often seen as authoritative and therefore representing objective Truth. Being a cartographer comes with a lot of responsibility. Still today, once you display something in the form of a map it's rarely questioned for its veracity. And yet, the real Truth is that all maps only represent partial truths.\r\n\r\nSo much of the mapping process is dependent on the positionality of the mapmaker and all of the subjective decisions that they must make when deciding what will be mapped, how the data will be manipulated, and how it will be visualized.\r\n\r\n# Ethics of Mapping Continued: Questions to Consider\r\n\r\nImportant ethical decisions that every mapmaker must consider are:\r\n\r\n- **What data should I use?** If you choose to use data that's already collected (e.g. Census data), are you using it because it's the easiest to access or because it's the most appropriate data to answer your research question? What are the limitations of using data that hasn't been collected or managed by you?\r\n- **How should I classify the data?** What categories will you create? For example, if you are working with racial demographics, will you report on the categories such as Latinx, non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, Latinx White, Latinx Black, etc, or will you provide broader categories such as people of color and white? What are the implications of choosing more general categories?\r\n- **At what resolution or scale should the data be aggregated?** If you are studying a phenomena at the neighborhood level, how do you define the boundaries of a neighborhood? Is it based on the school district, the Census Designated Place (CDP), the voting district, or maybe a boundary that doesn't have a formal delineation, such as a sense of community among people?\r\n- **What are the implications of aggregating the data at a certain scale?** For example, let's say you are studying the differences between urban and suburban areas. If you aggregate your data at the level of counties, what could be missing from that representation of the data? Is something happening at the level of the neighborhood or town, which could prove useful to answer your research question? This is not to say that the smallest scales are always the best to work with, but rather to suggest that when we aggregate data, we need to be aware of what distinctions we are hiding in the process.\r\n- **What colors and symbols should I use?** Should you represent a population in red or blue? Red normally signals something that is alarming, while blue is a more neutral color. These subjective cartographic design decisions greatly impact viewer's understanding of the map.\r\n\r\nFor more guiding questions on ethical decision making, please see [\"Ethical Decision-Making\"](https://serc.carleton.edu/geoethics/Decision-Making), a robust resource put together by the \"Community of Earth Educators.\"\r\n\r\n![Quote: \"We conceive 'mapping' as a practice, an action of thought in which the map is only one of the tools promoting an approach and deep analysis of social, subjective, and geographic territories.\" (Dúo Iconoclasistas)](/images/mapping/quote2.png)\r\n\r\nWith all of the subjective decisions that go into mapmaking, those working in the tradition of feminist GIS and critical cartography have stressed the importance of contextualizing one's map. Maps do not speak for themselves. We need to add context that allows the viewer to understand all of the decisions that were made while making the map. This form of transparency will help tell the story that you are trying to communicate.\r\n\r\n## Further Resources\r\n\r\nFor more about the history of mapping, and to learn about current countermapping projects, see these resources:\r\n\r\n- [Manual of Collective Mapping](https://www.academia.edu/28625755/Manual_of_Collective_Mapping_Critical_cartographic_resources_for_territorial_processes_of_collaborative_creation_2016_). Critical cartographic resources for territorial processes of collaborative creation.\r\n- [Counter Mapping: Zuni Maps](https://emergencemagazine.org/feature/counter-mapping/).\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nHave a look at [this map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html?action=click\u0026module=Spotlight\u0026pgtype=Homepage) of vaccination by county and state. Imagine the map in red instead of green. Do you think that might shift some people's feelings towards the vaccine, even if on a subconscious level? Also, have a look at the two different maps--one aggregated by county and the other by state. How does the level of aggregation change what the map tells us?\r\n\r\n# Making an Interactive Map: Introduction\r\n\r\nEvery map should start with a good research question. But what makes for a good mapping research question? The key, I find, is to start with a simple, answerable question. It's often the case that a seemingly simple and boring question can lead to bigger and more interesting questions. However, if you start with the big, complex question, it could be too overwhelming. So start small and then build on your question, if needed. Also, what do I mean by \"answerable\"? In the mapping world, this can mean several things. It could mean a question that can be answered by using preexisting data or data that can realistically be collected by the mapmaker. Suppose you want to map how Americans in different counties feel about a certain issue, but that national survey hasn't been done and you don't have the resources to do it, then this would fall under the category of an unanswerable question. Also if you want to map boundaries that haven't been created, such as homeschool pods, then this might be an unanswerable question (again if you don't have the resources to create the boundary from scratch).\r\n\r\nBy these standards, for this workshop we have a simple, easily answerable question.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Research Question\r\n\r\nDo Black Lives Matter protests tend to take place more in majority Black neighborhoods, perhaps as a tactic to build solidarity, or in majority non-Black, perhaps as a tactic to raise awareness?\r\n\r\n## Exploring the Data\r\n\r\nWhat kind of data do we need to make this map?\r\n\r\n- **Location of protests.** This data didn't exist, so I had to create it. I tried to find all of the protests that took place from May 28, 2020 to June 3, 2020. Since this was based on my own ability to capture the data from news articles, I assume that there are protests that happened during that week that are not in my dataset. When I publish my map, it will be important to state this assumption and include the methodology for how this data was collected.\r\n- **Shapes to represent the neighborhoods.** For NYC neighborhoods we can download a shapefile (which is a form of spatial data) from NYC Open Data. The file can be [downloaded here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq). Click on \"Export\" and select \"Shapefile\". A compressed folder will download. Move the folder out of your downloads and into a folder on your computer were you will be keeping all of the data for this workshop. When you open the folder you will notice there are four different files in there that all have the same name, yet are a different file type. In order for a shapefile to work, all of this data needs to stay together. Please compress the folder, so that the entire folder can be uploaded into our mapping software when we are ready to use it.\r\n- **Census data on race by neighborhood.** Census generated demographic data can be downloaded as a CSV file from the Census website. I've already downloaded the spreadsheet and cleaned it up for us so that it only has the variables that we are interested in—`GeoName` (neighborhood name), `GeoID` (a unique identifier for each neighborhood), and `BINHP` (Percent Black). You can find this file on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/mapping/blob/v2.0/dataset/racebyneighborhood.csv). Please download it as well.\r\n\r\n### Preview the Result\r\n\r\nTo get a better idea of what we will be building together, you can take a look at a final version of the [Location of BLM Protests Map](http://arcg.is/1KyC9O).\r\n\r\n# Combining Data Through a Spatial Join\r\n\r\n![Image detailing the process of combining data in a \"spatial join\"](/images/mapping/data.png)\r\n\r\nSince our neighborhood data are in two separate files, we'll need to perform a \"spatial join\" to combine them into one file. During the spatial join we will add the data on percent black by neighborhood that's in our CSV to the neighborhood shapefile, which is a polygon layer. Remember that only vector data (points, lines and polygons) or raster data (pixels) is geographic data. Also, remember that vector data is typically stored as a shapefile, so when you have a shapefile, you know it's geographic data. A CSV is not geographic data, even if it might have geographic data in it, such as addresses. A CSV is a text file, so it needs to be combined with geographic data to be visualized on a map. This is why we will need to use a *spatial join*.\r\n\r\n## What's a \"Spatial Join\"?\r\n\r\nWell, I'm glad you asked because a [*spatial join*](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/spatialjoin) is one of the most common GIS operations! There are two types of spatial joins--*spatial join by attribute* and *spatial join by location*. Both of them are ways that the mapping software will let you add data from one map layer or file to another map layer. A *spatial join by attribute* is used when you want to join non-spatial data, such as a text file, to spatial data, such as a shapefile. A *spatial join by location* is used when you want to join two layers of spatial data (e.g. a points layer to a polygon layer). Let's say you are working with the map of the U.S. used in the introduction and you want to aggregate information at the city level (the point layer) to the level of the state (the polygon layer). For this you will use a *join by location* since you are comparing two layers with spatial data.\r\n\r\nSince we are joining a CSV file (non-spatial data) with a shapefile (spatial data) we will need to use a *join by attribute*.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this both files need to be the same resolution (e.g. NYC neighborhood). A [resolution](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/resolution.md) is the scale at which the data is aggregated and displayed. Additionally, both files need to have a column with the same unique identifiers—this will serve as a key to match the two data files. When you work with data from the government, such at Census data, each geographical unit (e.g. each different neighborhood) will be given a unique identifier, so if both your data and your shapefile are from the government then the unique identifiers will match.\r\n\r\nNow that we have the concepts for what a spatial join means, we can move on to performing the spatial join on our data.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nA spatial join by attribute is used when you want to join which combination of layers:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- spatial data to non-spatial data*\r\n- spatial data to spatial data\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Spatial Join](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/spatialjoin) \r\n- [Polygon](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/polygon.md)\r\n- [Resolution](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/resolution.md)\r\n\r\n# Performing a Spatial Join\r\n\r\nWe will use QGIS which is a free and open source mapping software that will allow us to do pretty much any spatial operation that you could ever want! If you haven't yet installed QGIS you can do so by following these [installation instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/main/sections/qgis.md).\r\n\r\n### Open QGIS\r\n\r\nAfter installing, go ahead and open QGIS. When you open the application, you'll see an interface that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot overviewing QGIS's interface](/images/mapping/qgisinterface.png)\r\n\r\n## Adding Demographic Data to QGIS\r\n\r\nLet's add our data that needs to be joined. Follow the steps below to help you through the process.\r\n\r\n1. To add our [CSV](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/csv.md) of demographic data, `racebyneighborhood.csv`, open the **Data Source Manager**—this button is located in the top left corner of the interface and looks like three pieces of colored paper stacked on top of each other.\r\n2. When the Data Source Manager is open, select the **Delimited Text** option.\r\n3. On the right side of the **File name** section, click on the three dots to locate the file. Then click **Add**.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of QGIS's data source manager](/images/mapping/datasourcemanager.png)\r\n\r\nYou should now see the file appear in your Layers panel. You'll also see that nothing happens in your map display panel; this is because a CSV file is a text file. Remember that only vector data and raster data has features that can be mapped. A CSV file by itself is not mappable. That's why we need to combine it with the neighborhood shapefile. Note that if you happen to have precise location data in your CSV, such as addresses or latitude and longitude coordinates, the mapping software will be able to read it and convert it into vector data through a process called *geocoding*. When you don't have precise location data, you will need to use a *join by attribute* to add the text data to a shapefile. \r\n\r\n## Adding Vector Data from Our Shapefile to QGIS\r\n\r\nNow let's add our shapefile of New York City:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Go back to the **Data Source Manager** and this time select **Vector**.\r\n2. Under **Source type**, the \"file\" option should be selected.\r\n3. Where it says **Vector datasets**, use the browse feature again to find the shapefile on your computer and click **Add**.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of adding vector layer](/images/mapping/addvectorlayer.png)\r\n\r\nNow you should see that the file shows up in your Layers Panel, and it also displays as a map layer on your display panel.\r\n\r\n## Inspecting the Attribute Table\r\n\r\nLet's look at the data in the attribute table to see what we're working with. Each file has its own attribute table, so let's look at them one at a time. To do so, right-click on the `racebyneighborhood.csv` file and select \"Open attribute table.\" _If you see the three variables—`GeoName`, `GeoID`, and `BINHP`—then we're good to go!_\r\n\r\nLet's open the attribute table for the \"Neighborhood Tabulation Area\" shapefile. Right-click on that layer and select \"Open attribute table.\"\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of attribute table](/images/mapping/ntaattributetable.png)\r\n\r\nIn the table, you will see the variables: `boro_code` (borough code), `boro_name` (borough name), `county_fip` (the unique identifier for each county), `ntacode` (the unique identifier for each neighborhood), `ntaname` (neighborhood name), `shape_area` (surface area of each neighborhood in decimal degrees) and `shape_leng` (the length of the perimeter of each neighborhood in decimal degrees).\r\n\r\nYou will notice that both files have a variable in common—the `ntacode` in the shapefile is the same as the `GeoID` in the CSV file. These two variables will serve as our keys that will be used to match and join the files together.\r\n\r\nA spatial join won't work unless the fields are the same [data type](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/attributetype.md) —integer, double, string, etc. To see the field type, double-click on each layer and navigate to the \"Fields\" tab. The `ntacode` and the `GeoID` are both string variables, so we are all set for our join.\r\n\r\n## Performing a Spatial Join\r\n\r\nNow we are ready for our spatial join!\r\n\r\n1. In the layers panel, double click on the shapefile layer, \"Neighborhood Tabulation Area\". Then click on **Joins** and click on the **green plus sign**. A new dialog will appear on the screen. This is where you will configure your spatial join.\r\n2. Select `racebyneighborhood` for the **Join layer** option since that is the map layer you are joining to the neighborhood shapefile.\r\n3. Select `GeoID` for the **Join field** option.\r\n4. The **Target field** should be `ntacode`.\r\n5. Where it says **Custom Field Name Prefix**, you can click the checkbox and change the prefix. This prefix will be added to the variable name of every join layer. You can change it to something shorter or you can simply delete the text so no prefix is added. I'm going to delete mine.\r\n6. Lastly, click **OK** to save the configuration of the spatial join.\r\n7. To run the join, click **OK** in the following dialog.\r\n\r\n_Note: `GeoID` and `ntacode` are the two variables that match from the two mapping layers. This is why we are using them in step 3 and 4 above as the **Join field** and **Target field**._\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing the steps in this section to perform a \"spatial join\"](/images/mapping/joins.png)\r\n\r\nTo check to see if the join was successful, we'll need to look at the neighborhood shapefile's attribute table and see if the variables from the CSV file are there.\r\n\r\nRight-click on the shapefile layer and select **Open attribute table**. If you scroll to the right you should see the three variables from the CSV file—`GeoName`, `GeoID`, and `BINHP`. If you see them, then you've successfully completed a spatial join!\r\n\r\nSince our shapefile layer has been updated with new data, lets rename it. To do so, right-click on the shapefile layer in the Layers Panel and select **Rename**. I'm going to rename mine `NYCntaPerBlack`. This name will let me know that the data has New York City neighborhood tabulation areas and percent black.\r\n\r\n## Recap: Two Different Types of Spatial Joins\r\n\r\nMapping softwares typically offer two different types of spatial joins—join by attribute and join by location.\r\n\r\n- **Join by attribute** is the type of join what we just did; it’s based on matching two layers based on a shared attribute or variable.\r\n- **Join by location** is when you have two shapefiles that you want to combine based on where the features are located on the map. For example if you have a map of US states and you want to add information about its cities, you can run a spatial join by location. To learn more about this type of join, check out [How Spatial Join Works in GIS by GIS Geography](https://gisgeography.com/spatial-join/).\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nThe *Data Source Manager* is used to: (select one)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- import files into QGIS*\r\n- organize data files\r\n- stack map layers\r\n- export map layers\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nWhat's needed to perform a *spatial join by attribute*? (check all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- There must be a column in both datasets that matches and will serve as a key to link the two datasets.*\r\n- The columns that serve as a key must be the same data type.*\r\n- The text file must have precise location data, such as an address or latitude and longitude.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n- [Spatial join by attribute](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/joinbyattribute.md)\r\n- [Spatial join by location](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/joinbylocation.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Exporting Data from QGIS\r\n\r\nNow our neighborhood shapefile (containing the demographic information) is ready to be exported from QGIS and uploaded into ArcGIS Online where we will be able to turn it into an interactive map.\r\n\r\n### Preparing for the Export\r\n\r\nSince shapefiles are actually a set of 4-6 files, it's helpful to create a folder for them so they don't get mixed up with your other files. So, before we export the shapefile file, let's create a folder for it. \r\n\r\n1. Create a new folder somewhere on your computer where you are keeping the data for this workshop.\r\n2. Let's name the folder `NYCntaPerBlack.`\r\n\r\n## Exporting the Data\r\n\r\nNow we're ready to export the data.\r\n\r\n1. In QGIS, right-click on the neighborhood shapefile in the Layers panel. Then select **Export** and **Save Features As**.\r\n2. Under **File name** we need to tell QGIS which folder to export the file into. Use the three dots to navigate to the folder `NYCntaPerBlack`\r\n3. Next, you can click off the check box at the very bottom of the \"Save Vector Layer as…\" configuration box, where it says **Add saved file to map**. Since we already have this as a map layer in QGIS, there's no need to add it as another layer in the software.\r\n4. You can leave everything else in the configuration alone. Lastly, click **OK** to complete exporting the data.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing the steps above to export the shapefiles for the project](/images/mapping/exportnew.png)\r\n\r\nNavigate to your `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and check to see if all of the shapefiles are in there. There should be around 4–6 files in the folder. If there are, then your export was successful.\r\n\r\nThe last thing we have to do is **compress** the folder. ArcGIS Online will only import compressed shapefiles. If you're working on a Mac, right-click on the `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and click **compress**. If you're on a PC, right-click on the `NYCntaPerBlack` folder and select Send to and then **Compressed (zipped) folder**.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhy do we create a folder for the exported shapefile? (check all that apply)\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- The export won't work without it.\r\n- Shapefiles are actually 4-6 files, so it's a way to keep them organized and prevent accidentally separating them.*\r\n- ArcGIS will only import compressed shapefiles, so we need to create a folder to compress or zip the file.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Importing Data to ArcGIS Online\r\n\r\nNow we will be using ArcGIS Online to make the map interactive. Remember that we could have done everything in ArcGIS if we had the paid version, but since we are working with the free public version we cannot perform any spatial operations, such as the spatial join that we just did. That's why we used QGIS first. Now that we have the data exactly how we want it, we can use ArcGIS for free to visualize the data and create an interactive map.\r\n\r\n### Login to ArcGIS Online and Setup Interface\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll have to set yourself up with a free ArcGIS Online public account. To do so, open [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com), and click \"Sign in.\" If you don't already have an account, you can create one for free using your email, or your Google, Facebook or Github account.\r\n\r\nOnce you've logged in, let's open a new map project by selecting \"Map\" in the main menu.\r\n\r\nLet's get acquainted with the interface.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing ArcGISOnline's interface](/images/mapping/arcgisinterface.png)\r\n\r\n## Create a New Map and Add Your Data from QGIS to ArcGIS\r\n\r\nNow, let's import and format our neighborhoods shapefile.\r\n\r\n1. Click on **Add**.\r\n2. Click **Add Layer from File**.\r\n3. Select **Choose File**. Then navigate to where you have the compressed `NYCntaPerBlack` file saved on your computer.\r\n4. Select \"Generalize features for web display\". I've tried making maps with both this option and \"Keep original features\" and I've never noticed any difference. \r\n  - ArcGIS describes the benefits of this feature the following way: Generalizing reduces the precision of the shapefile layer to approximately 1 meter in Web Mercator and will remove vertices within 10 meters in Web Mercator. This should maintain an informative and accurate display of your features while reducing the overall size of your data and allowing your layer to quickly display in the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Click **Import Layer**.\r\n\r\nYou should now see something that looks like a map of New York City, where some automatic attribute (for example, borough) has been chosen by ArcGIS for coloration. In the example below, ArcGIS has automatically selected borough as an attribute to color on the map.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing what the map's styling looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/shapefileimport.png)\r\n\r\n# Changing the Map Style\r\n\r\nLet's change the attribute so that the colors represent the percentage of Black population in New York City's neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n1. Under **Choose an attribute to show**, select `BINHP` which stands for Black Non-Hispanic Population.\r\n2. Click around with the Drawing Styles to see which you think works best. I would suggest using the first option, a choropleth map style that shows the value by the intensity of the color.\r\n\r\nLet's change the color to something that makes sense.\r\n\r\n1. In the **Counts and Amounts** (Color) box click **Options**.\r\n2. Click **Symbols**, and change the color. I'm selecting the black/white color ramp since I think it fits in with the story I'm trying to tell.\r\n3. Once you've chosen your [color ramp](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/colorramp.md), click **OK**.\r\n4. Optional: You can click on **Classify** if you want to change how the data is visualized and how many categories are created. \"Natural breaks\" is a good option because it increases variability between classes while decreasing it within classes.\r\n5. Click the **OK** button at the bottom of the Layers Panel.\r\n6. Finally, click **Done** to save your changes to the map. If you don't click Done, it will revert to what you had before.\r\n\r\nYou should now see your maps styled with your new color ramp. You'll also see the `NYCntaPerBlack` map layer in the Layers Panel.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows what the map looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/colorrampchange.png)\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nPlay around with the symbology settings more. See how the map looks when you change the transparency, the number of classes and other features. To go back to the symbology settings, hover over the name of the map layer in the layers panel and select the *change style* button (the one with with three shapes--circle square and triangle). Then click *Options*.\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n- [color ramp](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/colorramp.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Configuring the Pop-up\r\n\r\nIf you click on your map, you'll see a pop-up window with all of the information contained in the attribute table.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows what the automatic pop-up window looks like in ArcGIS Online](/images/mapping/uglypopup1.png)\r\n\r\nAs you'll see, the pop-up doesn't look very nice. The names won't make much sense to the map viewer, and the viewer probably wouldn't be interested in some of the information, like the `ntacode`.\r\n\r\nLet's configure our pop-up so that it looks better and provides more useful information.\r\n\r\n1. In the map's Layers Panel, **hover over** where it has the name of the shapefile `NYCntaPerBlack`, and you will see some options appear below it—\"Show Legend\", \"Show Table\", \"Change Style\", and \"More Options.\"\r\n2. Select **More Options** by clicking the three dots below the name of the map layer.\r\n3. Select **Configure Pop-up**. The Layers Panel will turn into a panel for configuring the pop-up.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing the three steps above on the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/configurepopup.png)\r\n\r\nLet's explore the options that we have for the pop-up.\r\n\r\n1. The first thing you'll see is a checkbox for turning on and off the pop-up. We're going to leave ours on.\r\n2. In the **Pop-up Title**, you can enter a name that will be displayed at the top of every pop-up box. You can type in something. Or you can have one of the attributes displayed. Let's have the neighborhood name displayed in the pop-up title. To do this, **click the plus sign** to the right of the text box and select `ntaname`. Next to `ntaname`, write \"(Black%). Now the title will show the name of the neighborhood and the text \"(Black%)\".\r\n3. In the **Display**, select the drop-down to see the list of options. The options for what you can display in the pop-up are \"A list of attributes\", \"A description from one field\", \"A custom attribute display\", and \"no attribute information\". We are going to select **A description from one field** since we are only interested in showing the value for Percent Black. Then in the next drop-down **select `BINHP`**.\r\n4. Then click **OK** to save our changes.\r\n\r\nNow when you click on the map you should see a popup with just the name of the neighborhood plus the text \"(Black%)\" and then in the box you will see the value for Percent Black.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows what the map and the pop-up looks like after the steps above](/images/mapping/configurepopup2.png)\r\n\r\n# Importing CSV file and Geocoding Addresses\r\n\r\nNow we're ready to import our next mapping layer. This one will be the CSV file that we have of several BLM protests that took place during one week in June. We want to layer this data as points. The point layer will be displayed over the polygon map layer to see if the protests tended to take place in neighborhoods that were majority Black, or not.\r\n\r\nLet's import the file.\r\n\r\n1. Select **Add**.\r\n2. Select **Add Layer from File**.\r\n3. Select **Choose File**, and navigate to where you have the file `1 Week of Protests.csv` saved on your computer.\r\n4. Select **Import Layer**.\r\n\r\nAt this point a box should appear that says \"Add CSV Layer\" at the top and has information about location, coordinates and addresses.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows ArcGIS Online's \"Add CSV Layer\" dialog](/images/mapping/addcsv.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the ArcGIS's way of asking you if you want to convert the addresses that are stored in the CSV file into points on the map. This process is called \"[geocoding](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/geocoding.md).\" Geocoding is a spatial process that uses a *geographic address locator* to match addresses with location coordinates and create a point layer. It turns a text file (CSV) into a vector file (points layer). This process will only work if you have addresses or coordinates stored in your CSV file, and luckily we do! If you open the CSV file in a spreadsheet manager, you'll see that we have the fields `address`, `city`, `state` and `zip`. This is all the *geographic address locator* will need to be able to locate the address for each protest and create a map layer of points.\r\n\r\nTo geocode the CSV file, the **Field Name** column (pulled from the CSV file) needs to match with the **Location Fields** column (which is the geocoder column). Make sure that the following fields match:\r\n\r\n1. Field Name: Address = Location Fields: Address or Place\r\n2. Field Name: City = Location Fields: City\r\n3. Field Name: State = Location Fields: State\r\n4. Field Name: Zip = Location Fields: Zip\r\n\r\nIf they don't match, then click on the cell(s) to change it. Most likely, since the mapping software is pretty good at this stuff, they will all be automatically matched, so you won't have to change anything. Finally, click **Add Layer**.\r\n\r\n\u003cInfo\u003e__Note__: ArcGIS will only geocode up to 100 entries. If you have more than 100, you can use the Census Geocoder which allows you to geocode up to 1000 entries.\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n- [geocoding](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/geocoding.md)\r\n\r\n# Changing the Style of the Points Layer\r\n\r\nNow you should see a series of points on top of the neighborhood map layer. ArcGIS Online will automatically use an attribute to style the point layer. In my example, it automatically chose \"Start location.\"\r\n\r\nLet's change the style of the points layers so that the symbology is not based on an attribute. I'm not really interested in displaying any particular attribute along with the protests. I just want to see the location of the protests.\r\n\r\n1. Under **Choose an attribute to show**, select \"Show location only.\"\r\n2. Now let's change the color of the points. In the box that says Location (single symbol) choose **OPTIONS**.\r\n3. Select **Symbols**.\r\n4. Feel free to play around with the options for the style of the point. You can change the shape, the fill color, the outline, and the size. You can even upload your own image. For mine, I chose an orange star that's size 12.\r\n5. Select **OK**.\r\n6. And select **OK** again.\r\n7. Finally, select **DONE** to save your changes.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing what the point layer looks like once it has been formatted according to the points above](/images/mapping/protestsformatted2.png)\r\n\r\nWith this map, we should already be able to answer our research question. We wanted to know if there might be a relationship between the location of BLM protests and the racial demographic of the neighborhood, specifically if the neighborhood is majority Black. Here we can already see little correlation between the location of the protests and the racial demographic of the neighborhood. We can observe, however, that many of the protests are taking place in centrally located places in Manhattan and in some parts of Brooklyn. If we click on the points, we'll also see that many of the location starting points are popular sites and meeting places, such as Times Square, Union Square, and Bryant Park.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\nPlay around with the symbology settings a bit more. See what happens when you change the *visible range*. What do you think this option is for? For the answer check out [this article](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/set-visibility.htm).\r\n\r\n# Formatting the Pop-ups for the Protest Locations\r\n\r\nLet's format the pop-ups for the protest locations so that the map viewer can learn more about the sites. The attributes that can be displayed are: \"Date\", \"Start Location\", \"Address\", \"City\", \"State\", \"Zip\", \"Photo\", \"Details.\"\r\n\r\nOut of these options, let's display the \"Start Location\", \"Photo\" and \"Details.\"\r\n\r\n1. In the **Map Layers Panel**, hover over where it has the name of the points layer \"1 Week of Protest\" and select the three dots for **More Options**. Then select **Configure Pop-up**.\r\n2. In **Pop-up Title** write \"BLM Protest\"\r\n3. In **Display** select \"A list of field attributes.\"\r\n4. Select **Configure Attributes**.\r\n\r\nNow you should see a dialog that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows the dialog for formatting the map's protest layer according to attributes](/images/mapping/popupprotest1.png)\r\n\r\nHere, you can decide which attributes to display by clicking the checkboxes under the **Display** column. You can also edit the **TextBox Type** by having the checkboxes under the **Edit** column selected. Lastly, you can change the name that appears for the attribute in the pop-up. To do this click on the words in the column **Field Alias** and it will allow you to put in new text. Let's try some of these options.\r\n\r\n1. In the **Display** column select \"Start Location\" and \"Details.\" Even though we also want to add \"photo\" we are not going to check that off here. Media needs to be configured through a different process, which we'll do next.\r\n2. You don't have to change anything in the **Edit** column.\r\n3. Under Field Alias click on the word **Details** and change it to \"Protest info.\"\r\n4. Click **OK**.\r\n\r\nNow let's add our photo to the pop-up. Under **Pop-up Media** select **Add \u003c Image**. You should see the following dialog:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows the dialog that allows for us to format the image shows in the map's pop-up](/images/mapping/configureimage.png)\r\n\r\nLet's try some of the options that are available to us.\r\n\r\n1. In **Title** delete the text and leave it blank.\r\n2. Leave the Caption blank.\r\n3. For the **URL**, click the plus sign and select \"Photo\". You might have to scroll down to find it in the list of attributes.\r\n4. Click **OK**.\r\n5. Click **OK** again to save your changes.\r\n\r\nNow you should see a nicer looking pop-up when you click on the points on your map. Some points don't have any \"Protest info,\" but for all of them you should see the \"start location\" and photo.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot showing what the pop-up looks like after following all the steps in this section](/images/mapping/finalpopupdone.png)\r\n\r\n# Formatting the Legend\r\n\r\nA map legend is a visual explanation of the symbols used on the map. It typically includes a sample of each symbol (point, line, or polygon), and a short description of what the symbol means. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot that shows where the legend is located in the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/viewlegend.png)\r\n\r\nLet's have a quick look at the legend to make sure that it will be informative for our map viewer.\r\n\r\n1. In the Map Layers Panel, at the top, you should see three icons—an \"i\" with a blue circle around it, followed by a paper with blue writing, and then a bulleted list. Click on the icon that looks like a bulleted list; that's the legend icon.\r\n2. I think the legend generally looks okay, but it currently displays the name of the map layer, which can be a little confusing for the viewer, especially the layer `NYCntaPerBlack`. Let's rename the layers so it will be easier for the viewer to understand.\r\n3. Go back to the Map Layer panel where you can see the hyperlinked layers. You can do this by clicking the icon that looks like a white sheet of paper with blue writing.\r\n4. Then click on the three dots for **More Options** and select **Rename**.\r\n5. Do this for both layers to rename them something that's easier to read. I'm going to name mine \"BLM Protests (May 28 to June 3, 2020)\" and \"NYC Neighborhoods by Percent Black.\"\r\n\r\n# Saving and Sharing Your Map\r\n\r\nNow it's finally time to save and share your map!\r\n\r\n1. To save the map, click the **Save** button (with the floppy disk icon). Enter your title, tags, and summary to describe the map. Then click **Save Map**.\r\n2. To share your map, click on the **Share** button (with the chain link icon).\r\n3. Click the checkmark next to **Everyone (public)** so that you can share the map with the public. Once you do that, all of the share options will become available to you, including sharing the URL to the map or getting embed code to put the map on a website.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot detailing the steps in this section and where they are located in the ArcGIS Online interface](/images/mapping/savemap.png)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You've made an informative and interactive map with two layers of spatial data, multiple pop-ups, and even multimedia with your pop-ups!\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\n### Review your knowledge: 4 questions from the lessons\r\n\r\n__1.

You can even take the reader to different points around the map and give them information about each location.\r\n\r\n### Discussion Questions\r\n\r\n- In the workshop we learned that every map should begin with a simple and answerable research question. What else makes for a good mapping research question? Remember that maps can be exploratory so we don't need to fully answer the question. \r\n- What makes a map ethical or unethical?\r\n- Think about the audience or audiences for your map. Do you think different audiences should warrant constructing the map in different ways? \r\n\r\n### More Resources\r\n\r\n- [Finding data for mapping: tips and tricks](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/11/24/finding-data-for-mapping-tips-and-tricks/).\r\n- [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/) for a compilation of cool maps and visualization tips.","title":"Mapping Workshop","description":"In the past decade, interactive maps have become one of the most popular ways to visualize and explore spatial data.

Mapmakers need to decide what data to represent and what to leave out. They also need to decide how to aggregate, categorize, project, combine, and visualize the data. All of these decisions will influence the story that the map tells. Additionally, as a critical tool of Western colonialism and imperialism, maps wield great authority. As mapmakers, it's essential to be conscious of this history not to reproduce harmful power dynamics through mapmaking. Once something is visualized in the form of a map, it is often understood as a Truthful representation of reality. Therefore, mapmakers have an important responsibility to be as honest and transparent as possible. Since the 1980's, there have been two emerging disciplines in academia—critical cartography and feminist GIS—that have brought to light many of the harmful applications of mapping.

To that end, all of the Python programming you will learn about can be done here, __directly in your browser__. Throughout the workshop, you will encounter several designated code sections in which you can write and run your Python code. These emulators are meant to allow you quick and easy access to coding principles. However, there are many ways to interact with Python, and you will also learn about how to interact with your Python installation locally on your machine. \r\n\r\nWith that said, let's get started!\r\n\r\n## The Interactive Session\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic ways to interact with Python is through an \"interactive session.\"  This is a special space that allows us to run little one-line bits of Python, experimenting and exploring what it can do, without having to save it. Think of this interactive space as a playground. Later on, we will be working with Python in a more robust way, executing longer Python scripts.\r\n\r\nAn interactive session, otherwise known as the __REPL__ (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), is a basic environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the results to the user. A typical REPL environment in the terminal looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nPython 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34)\r\n[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it first shows the current Python version along with some hints for help or licensing information. Next, you will see three very important greater-than signs: `\u003e\u003e\u003e`. \r\n\r\nThese greater-than symbols `\u003e\u003e\u003e` are how you know that you have entered an interactive session with Python, as distinct from the normal `$` terminal prompt (or `%` if you are on MacOS). Let's work with this environment a bit.\r\n\r\n## A Little Math\r\n\r\nLet's try a little math in the Python prompt. In the Python REPL environment below \u003cspan style = \"color:green\"\u003e(shown in green text)\u003c/span\u003e, type the following mathematical operations after the Python prompt (the `\u003e\u003e\u003e`), and hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e or \u003ckbd\u003ereturn\u003c/kbd\u003e after each operation.\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 2 + 3\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 14 - 10\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 10 * 10\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 6 / 3\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e 21 % 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nThe first four operations above are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The last operation is _modulo_, or mod, which returns the remainder after division.\r\n\r\nNote the way you interact with Python at the prompt. After entering an expression such as `2 + 3`, Python \"evaluates\" it to a simpler form, `5`, and then prints out the answer for you. **This process is what is meant by the Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL**. Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input.\r\n\r\nThe REPL is useful for quick tests and, later, can be used for exploring and debugging your programs interactively. As mentioned, you might consider it a kind of playground for testing and experimenting with Python expressions.\r\n\r\n## Opening the REPL in the Terminal\r\n\r\nAlthough we have provided you with an emulated REPL environment to work with here in your browser, you can also begin an interactive session locally in your own computer's terminal or command prompt. If you have Python installed, you simply need to open your terminal and type:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python\r\n```\r\n\r\nat the prompt and hit \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. This will start the Python REPL environment, and you can interact it with it just as you did with the math example above. You can get out of Python by hitting \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ed\u003c/kbd\u003e (or \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ez\u003c/kbd\u003e or \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ez\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e if you're on a computer running Windows) or by typing `exit()`. You can get back in the REPL again by typing `python` at the regular `$` prompt. \r\n\r\n\u003cInfo\u003eRemember that you're in the Python REPL when you see `\u003e\u003e\u003e`, and you're in bash or your terminal when you see the `$`.\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nOne operator (math symbol) we didn't learn is the exponent—e.g., \"x raised to the power of...\" If you were Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, how would you define this operator?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003eThe exponent operator is two asterisks. For example, the number 3 to the power of 2 would be expressed as 3**2.\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat are the characteristics of the REPL? Select all that apply.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `$`.\r\n- The REPL has a prompt that begins with `\u003e\u003e\u003e`.*\r\n- The REPL and the terminal are the same thing.\r\n- The REPL can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions like `2 + 2`.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [REPL](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/REPL.md)\r\n\r\n# Types\r\n\r\nTypes are classifications that let the computer know how a programmer intends to use a piece of data. You can just think of them as, well, types of data.\r\n\r\nWe've already seen one type in the last section with our math examples: the integer. In this section, we'll learn four more: the floating point number, the string, the boolean, and the list.\r\n\r\nIn the Python REPL environment below, write the following commands one line at a time, hitting \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e after each to see the result.\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type(1)\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type(1.0)\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type(\"Hello there!\")\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type(True)\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose is happening here? Well, each of the responses show how the different types of data register as different \"types\" for Python:\r\n\r\n**Integers** (like `1` above) are whole numbers.\r\n\r\n**Floats** (like `1.0` above) are numbers with decimals, and are treated a little differently than integers.\r\n\r\n**Strings** (like `\"Hello there!\"` above) are arbitrary sets of characters, such as letters and numbers. You can think of them as a way to store text.\r\n\r\n**Booleans**: (like `True` above) is a fancy term for values representing \"true\" and \"false,\" or \"truthiness\" and \"falsiness.\" In Python they are always capitalized: `True` and `False`.\r\n\r\n**Lists**: (like `[1, 2, 3]` above) are ordered collections of values. You can put any of the other types in a list: `[\"hello\", \"goodbye\", \"see ya later\"]` is also a valid list.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about trying to actively remember these types. We'll be working with each in turn in the following sections.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nUsing the Python REPL, find __1)__ the type of `(\"12\")`, and __2)__ the type of `([\"dog\", 13, 3.0])`. What do you think the results will be for each?\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n1: Writing type(\"12\") will return the type of string. While 12 is an integer, enclosing a number within quotation marks will result in a type of string. \r\n2: Writing type([\"dog\", 13, 3.0]) will result in a list. Individually, while dog is a string, 13 is an integer, and 3.0 is a float, putting these elements together in brackets results in a list object being returned. As you can see, a list can contain items of different types.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## What's the deal with type()?\r\n\r\n`type()` is a function. You can think of functions in Python in a few different ways:\r\n\r\n1. A way of doing something in Python.\r\n2. A way of saving some code for reuse.\r\n3. A way of taking an input, transforming that input, and returning an output. The input goes in the parentheses `()`.\r\n\r\nThese are all valid ways of thinking about functions. We'll be learning more about functions in later sections.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nOpen your web browser, and google the phrase \"python function.\" Skim through the first few results. What words do you recognize, and which ones look unfamiliar? What do you think the unfamiliar ones mean? Try to rephrase some of this new language, and guess what they mean in your own words.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\nWhen you google \"python function,\" you may see some phrases that look unfamiliar, like \"return value\" or \"pass parameters.\" These are advanced terms for inputting and outputting data from a function. It's important to become familiar with the Python's terminology about functions, as it will be helpful later on when you start working with these components.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nSelect all the following that accurately describe the data type categories.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Booleans represent only `True` or `False` values.*\r\n- Integers can be expressed with numbers like `1` or letters `one`.\r\n- Strings can contain numbers within quotations, like `\"1\"`.*\r\n- Lists can contain strings, like `['banana, 'coffee', 'eggs']`.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Boolean](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/boolean.md)\r\n- [Float](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/float.md)\r\n- [Integer](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/integer.md)\r\n- [String](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/string.md)\r\n- [List](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/list.md)\r\n- [Type()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/type.md)\r\n- [Function](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/function.md)\r\n\r\n# Variables\r\n\r\nA variable is **a symbol that refers to an object**, such as a string, integer, or list. Try each of the following commands in order in the Python REPL below, hitting \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e after each:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e x = 5\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e x\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e y = \"hello\"\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e y\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e y + \" and goodbye\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the examples above, the `=` sign lets you assign symbols like `x` and `y` to data.\r\n\r\nVariables can be longer words as well, and they can be set to lists. For instance, type the following into the REPL:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia','Living a Feminist Life']\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e books\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e type(books)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\n...you can see that we have assigned the `list` variable `books` three different book items to work with.\r\n\r\nVariables can have letters, numbers, and underscores, **but should generally start with a letter**.\r\n\r\nIf you are curious about learning more about naming conventions for variables, you can check out the PEP8 style guide's section on [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). PEP8 is the widely accepted guide for Python programmers everywhere.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nSo I just told you that variables shouldn't start with a number. What does that even mean? Will your computer explode if you write `1_book = \"Gender Trouble\"`?\r\n\r\nOnly one way to find out. Try giving weird names to variables and see if you can learn a bit about the rules:\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\nThere are a few rules regarding the way that you write the variable statement. This is because Python reads everything left to right, and needs things to be in a certain order.\r\nFirst, you cannot use any numbers or special characters to start a variable name. So 1_book, 1book, or any variable that contains special characters @, #, $, $, etc, wouldn't be acceptable in Python. You must start the variable with a letter and avoid using special characters.\r\nYou can incorporate numbers after you've started with a letter. So book_1 or b1 is acceptable, though you cannot use special characters at any point in the variable name.\r\nSecond, you might also notice that variable syntax requires you to write the variable name first, followed by an equal sign =, and then the value, or data. You cannot start the variable statement with the data value, because Python always recognizes the first thing written as the thing to be assigned. The thing that comes after the = is the data that becomes attached to the preceding variable.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nSelect all the variable expressions that are allowed in Python.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `1 = one`\r\n- `one = 1`*\r\n- `$$$ = \"dollar_signs\"`\r\n- `first_book = \"Orlando\"`*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Variables](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/variables.md)\r\n\r\n# Running Scripts\r\n\r\nSo far, you've interacted with Python one line at a time in the REPL. This is what we call the Interactive Mode, which is, as we mentioned, like a playground for experimenting and exploring different Python expressions, such `2 + 2` or `type(\"some stuff\")`. The code that we write in the REPL is not saved after you exit the terminal, which means that this space is for running Python expressions and *not* for writing longer programs.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of this session, we're going to expand beyond the REPL to write and execute longer programs. To do this, we will begin to work with a code editor, where we write out lengthier Python scripts.\r\n\r\n## Your First Script\r\n\r\nTo open the code editor, click the Open Editor button below. Then, type the following line into the code editor and click the RUN button in the slide-out panel:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should see the text `Hello World!` appear in the output below the code editor in the shell.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You've written your first script. That's a big deal!\r\n\r\n## Running A Script Locally with the Terminal and a Text Editor\r\n\r\nWhile we have provided you with a code editor to work with here in the browser, when programming your own projects you will likely be working with a text editor and the terminal installed locally on your machine. First, let's begin with the text editor. Open your text editor of choice (such as Visual Studio Code) and create a new file with this line:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave it with the name `hello.py` to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you're in the folder with your `hello.py` file, move to the terminal. Do *not* enter the Python Interactive Mode (the REPL), which is unnecessary to run python scripts. Instead, lookout for the `$` symbol that lets you know you're in the terminal. (If you find yourself in the Interactive mode (`\u003e\u003e\u003e`), then try exiting it with \u003ckbd\u003econtrol\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003ed\u003c/kbd\u003e. You should see the `$` symbol, letting you know you're back in the terminal. If you still do not see the `$` symbol, type `exit()` followed by \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e after the Python prompt, `\u003e\u003e\u003e`.)\r\n\r\nNow that you're in the terminal, type the following, and press enter:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python hello.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see the text `Hello world!` appear as output in the terminal.\r\n\r\n\u003cInfo\u003eYou might have noticed some suggestions pop up when you were typing in the code editor. This is a handy feature called \"code completion\", which is the computer trying to understand what you are typing and giving you quick suggestions. Many code editors have this feature and it can be useful to save you time and help you understand what a particular function needs as parameters.\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n## A Note on Text\r\n\r\nFundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in any text editor, like Visual Studio Code or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about `.py` files—they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git. The tools you can learn through the DHRI Curriculum—the command line, Git, markdown, grep—are all designed to work well together, and the medium through which they all work is plain text.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nRewrite your program so that you assign the \"Hello World!\" message to a variable, then print the variable. This will make your program two lines instead of one. There's a fancy programmer word for rewriting your code without changing its behavior—\"refactoring.\"\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nYour code should look something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```python\r\ngreeting = \"Hello World!\"\r\nprint(greeting)\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\nThen, when you run the code, you should see the following output:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```console\r\nHello world!\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat are the differences between the terminal, REPL, and text editor? Select the correct statement from the below options.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- You can run scripts from the **terminal** that were written on the text editor.*\r\n- The **REPL** allows you to save scripts for later use.\r\n- The **text editor** allows you to test code on the fly.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [REPL](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/repl.md)\r\n- [Scripts](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/scripts.md)\r\n- [print()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/print.md)\r\n\r\n# Errors in Python\r\n\r\nOur usual response when seeing an error on a computer screen is a stress response. Our heart rate elevates and, if we cannot do what we were asking the computer to do, our frustration mounts. This is because many errors when interacting with programs are not useful or informative, and because we often have no capability to fix the program in front of us.\r\n\r\nIn Python, errors are our friends. This might be hard to accept initially, but the errors you see when running Python scripts generally do a good job of pointing you to what's going wrong in your program. When you see an error in Python, therefore, try not to fall into the stress response you may be used to when interacting with your computer normally.\r\n\r\n## Two Kinds of Errors\r\n\r\nIn Python, there are two kinds of errors you will encounter frequently. One appears before the program runs, and the other appears during the execution of a program.\r\n\r\n**Syntax errors**: When you ask Python to run a program or execute a line in the REPL, it will first check to see if the program is valid Python code—that is, that it follows the grammatical or syntactical rules of Python. If it doesn't, before the program even runs, you'll see a syntax error printed out to the screen.\r\n\r\nAs an example, type the following in the Python REPL below:\r\n\r\n`print('This string has mismatched quotes.\")`\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should receive an error:  `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`, which points out that our line has faulty syntax. Note the caret (`^`) underneath the mismatched quote, helpfully pointing out where the error lies. Similarly, if this error happened when running a script, Python would tell us the filename and the line number for the line on which the error occurs.\r\n\r\n**Traceback errors**: These errors occur during the execution of a Python program when the program finds itself in an untenable state and must stop. Traceback errors are often logical inconsistencies in a program that is valid Python code. A common traceback error is referring to a variable that hasn't been defined, as below.\r\n\r\nAs an example, type the following in the Python REPL below:\r\n\r\n`print(not_a_variable)`\r\n\r\nYou should receive a Traceback error, indicating that we have not declared the variable `not_a_variable`. Traceback errors try to tell you a little about what happened in the program that caused the problem, including the category of error, such as `NameError` or `TypeError`.\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\n\r\nDebugging is a fancy word for fixing problems with a program. Here are some common strategies for debugging a program when first learning Python:\r\n\r\n__If the error is a syntax error:__\r\n\r\n1. Look at where the caret is pointing.\r\n2. Pay attention to grammatical features such as quotes, parentheses, and indentation.\r\n3. Consider reading the program, or the offending line, backward. It's surprising, but this often helps to detect the issue.\r\n\r\n__If the error is a traceback error:__\r\n\r\n1. First look at the line where the error occured, then consider the general category of error. What could have gone wrong?\r\n2. If the error is a name error (NameError), check your spelling.\r\n3. Try copying the last line of the error and pasting it into Google.

Often, a function takes an input, transforms the input, and returns an output. Imagine, for instance, a [penny press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongated_coin) at a popular tourist attraction that accepts a penny (the input), flattens and embosses the penny (the transformation), and spits out an elongated coin with a new design, perhaps an image of the Statue of Liberty (the output)! Or, for those of you who remember high school algebra, the function `f(x) = x + 1` means that given an input `x`, the function will return `x + 1`. For example, if I substituted `2` for `x`, my function would read `f(2) = 2 + 1`, or `f(2) = 3`. In this case, my input was `2`, the transformation was to add `1`, and the output was `3`. These are the basic concepts that make up a function in Python as well! \r\n\r\n## Writing your first function\r\n\r\nLet's write a Python function that prints the output from our algebraic equation `f(x) = x + 1` before. Try running the code in the editor below.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\ndef add_one(x):\r\n  print(x + 1) \r\nadd_one(2)\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nAs output, you should get the number `3`. Let's break this code down to understand how it works.\r\n\r\nFirst, we create a function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_one(x):\r\n  print(x + 1)\r\n```\r\n \r\nWhen creating a function, we begin by writing `def` before our chosen function name. The function name is typically descriptive in nature. We named the above function `add_one` following [Python naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names), as the function will be ADDING 1 to our inputted integer. We always need a closed parentheses `()` after our function name, which in this case, takes one argument (or input), which we will temporarily call `x` (we can name this parameter whatever we want, as long as we use the same name within the body of the function). Then, we end the first line with a `:`, return, and indent by 2 spaces to write code describing what this function should \"do.\" In this case, we want the function to `print` the result of adding `1` to our input, or `x`. Remember, we need parentheses every time we print something!\r\n\r\nNext, if we want to __call__ our function, we will need to actually pass in an argument to see a result. To do so, we write the following line of code below our function (making sure this next line _isn't_ indented):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nadd_one(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we are calling our function and telling the computer to pass in `2` to see if we get our expected output of `3`.\r\n\r\n### Optional \r\n\r\nTo see the magic of the function in action, try adding extra lines of code that call the function with different arguments in the code editor, like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nadd_one(155)\r\nadd_one(5)\r\nadd_one(-1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\ndef add_one(x):\r\n  print(x + 1) \r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nDo you notice how the function printed the sum of each of these numbers plus one? Writing this function helped us to automate this simple process of addition for each given input! Granted, creating a whole function just to add \"one\" to something may seem unnecessarily complicated, but once you have learned the basics of function-writing, the possibilities are powerful and limitless!\r\n\r\n### Advanced\r\nNote that writing a function this way only prints the result, but does not actually `return` it. Read more about the difference between `print` and `return` [here](https://pythonprinciples.com/blog/print-vs-return/). If we wanted our function to actually perform the operation AND print it, we could revise our code as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_one(x):\r\n  return x + 1\r\n\r\nprint(add_one(2))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Writing your second function\r\n\r\nOur functions do not have to be \"mathematical\" in nature. Let's say that I wanted to say a friendly hello, but didn't want to type out a long sentence every time I wanted to do so. We could automate this process with a function. In the code editor, write the following lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef greet():\r\n    print(\"Hello! How are you today?\")`  \r\ngreet()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nFirst we define our `greet()` function, and add a line to print to the screen. Lastly, we call the function so it will run. You might have noticed that this time, we didn't pass in an argument! Note that a function doesn't have to take an input (or argument), or it can take several arguments! There is a lot of flexibility involved in writing your own functions, which you can craft carefully to do exactly what you want them to! Read more about some of the many things you can do with functions on the online web tutorial [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nHow could we change our greeting function to say hello to a specific person? Hint: your print statement will need to use string interpolation. We did this in the \"Variables\" section when we assigned y to \"hello\" `y = \"hello\"`, and then added `y + \" and goodbye\"`, which yielded the result `\"hello and goodbye\"`.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\ndef greet(person):\r\n  print(\"Hello \" + person + \"! How are you today?\")\r\ngreet(\"Sarah\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\nAs you can see, the result of calling this function prints `\"Hello Sarah! How are you today?\"`\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich of the following are not true about a function?:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- A function can be reused\r\n- A function can take any number of arguments (including no arguments)\r\n- A function needs to be called in order to run\r\n- A function can only perform mathematical operations*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n- [argument](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)\r\n- [parameter](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) \r\n- [function](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/function.md)\r\n\r\n# Lists\r\n\r\nRemember lists? They look like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's create a list together and print it out. In the code editor, write the following lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\nprint(books)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should see the list printed out in the output.\r\n\r\nLet's try out another built-in function, called `len()`, which returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string. \r\n\r\nTake a look at the code provided for you in the editor below:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\n# print(books)\r\nlist_length = len(books)\r\nprint(list_length)\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nFirst, we have our list of books from before. Next, we \"comment out\" the `print(books)` statement with the hashtag `#`, which tells Python to _ignore_ that line of code. Comments are not read by the interpreter and are only for us humans. \r\n\r\nNext, let's break down this unfamiliar line of code: `list_length = len(books)`\r\n\r\n- __First__, we have saved a list of books to the variable, `books`.\r\n- __Second__, `list_length = len(book)` takes the `books` variable from the previous line as an *argument* (or input data) for the `len()` function. That's why `books` is within the parentheses. This syntax means that Python will run the `len()` function on the items in `books`. Then, it sets the result of that process to a new variable, called `list_length`.\r\n- __Finally__, we print the `list_length` value.\r\n\r\nThis might appear a bit complex at first, but if you read the line slowly you should be able to connect the dots.\r\n\r\nNotice that when you run the code above, you don't see the `books` list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a `#` (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.\r\n\r\n## List Indexing\r\n\r\nA useful property of a list is the list index. This allows you to pick out an item from within the list by a number starting from zero:\r\n\r\nFor instance, add the following lines of code to the program below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(books[0]) # Gender Trouble\r\nprint(books[1]) # Cruising Utopia\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\nprint(books)\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nIndexing lets us get at individual items from a particular list. Note that the first item in the list is `item[0]`. The second item is `item[1]`. That's because counting in Python, and in almost all programming languages, starts from `0`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can print out the last item in a list using negative numbers, where `-1` denotes the last item in the list. For instance, if you were to add:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(books[-1]) # Living a Feminist Life\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the books program, it would print the last item in the books list. `-2` would print the second to last item, `-3` the third to last, and so on.\r\n\r\n## Slicing Lists\r\n\r\nThere are many things you can do with list indexing, like _slicing_. Slicing consists of taking a section of a list, using the list index to pick out a range of list items. For example, you could take out the first _two_ items of a list with a slice that begins with `0` and ends with `2`.\r\n\r\nThe slice syntax consists of square brackets, start point and end point, and a colon to indicate the gap in between. This should print out the first two items of your list.  Go ahead and add the following line to the code below to see slicing in action:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(books[0:2])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nNote a couple of things. First, the start point is *inclusive*, meaning that Python will include the `[0]` item in your range, and the end point is _exclusive_, so Python won't print the `[2]` item. Instead, it will print everything _up until_ that `[2]` item.\r\n\r\nFor ultimate brevity, you can also write this expression as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(books[:2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe empty value before the colon allows Python to assume the range starts at the first list item, at `[0]`. You can also end the slice with `:`, if you want the list range to include all subsequent items until the end of the list. \r\n\r\nThe example below will print everything from the second item to the end of the list.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(books[1:])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a list that contains three items total, list slicing might not seem very impressive right now. However, this will become a powerful tool once we get to more sophisticated text analysis and start to encounter lists that contain hundreds (or thousands!) of items.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nIn the REPL below, create a new list of books with at least 5 books in your list. Make sure the total number of books in the list is an **odd** number. How do you get python to print out the book in the middle of the list? What about the three books in the middle? Remember that the first value in a slice is _inclusive_, and the final value is _exclusive_.\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e books = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality', 'The Undercommons']\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e books[2] # ['Living a Feminist Life']\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e books[1:4] # ['Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life', 'Radiant Textuality']\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nHow would you get Python to print the length of the last book in the list?

For that, we'll need something called a _loop_.\r\n\r\nAdd the following lines of code to the editor below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor book in books:\r\n    print(\"My favorite book is \" + book)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nbooks = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for loop\", and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor \u003cvariable name\u003e in \u003clist name\u003e:\r\n    \u003cdo something\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the `\u003cdo something\u003e` code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to `\u003cvariable name\u003e` in the `\u003cdo something\u003e` block.\r\n\r\nYou can also loop through items within a string. Type the following code into the editor to see the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor letter in \"hello\":\r\n    print(letter)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nThe result should print out each letter of the string `hello`, one by one.\r\n\r\n## A Note on Variable Names\r\n\r\nIn this section, we've discussed books in the context of a list. Why do we use the variable name `books` in this section for our list of book names? Why not just use the variable name `x`, or perhaps `f`?\r\n\r\nWhile the computer might not care if our list of books is called `x`, giving variables meaningful names makes a program considerably easier to read than it would be otherwise. Consider this for loop:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ny = ['Gender Trouble', 'Cruising Utopia', 'Living a Feminist Life']\r\n\r\nfor x in y:\r\n    print(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is easier to read, this `for` loop or the one used in the previous example?\r\n\r\nWhen variable names accurately reflect what they represent, and are therefore meaningful, we call them _semantic_.  Always try to create semantic variable names whenever possible.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\n1. Here's a list of numbers:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nWrite some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. Remember that the square of a number is that number times itself. The solution is below, but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. (Seriously! That's 210 seconds.)\r\n\r\n2. Look up a new concept—\"f-string\" (a formatting technique for strings)—on Google and, using the code editor above, use it to write a loop that gives the following output:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nThe square of 2 is 4.\r\nThe square of 3 is 9.\r\nThe square of 5 is 25.\r\nThe square of 7 is 49.\r\nThe square of 11 is 121.\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Note:__ the \"f-string\" is a new string formatting method for Python 3. You can [read more about this new string formatting method](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1. To get the square of the elements in the list `prime_numbers`, you can:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```python\r\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\r\n\r\nfor num in prime_numbers:\r\n    print(num * num)\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n2. Using \"f-strings\" to output the list of results in the challenge would look something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```python\r\nprime_numbers= [2,3,5,7,11]\r\nfor num in prime_numbers:\r\n    print(f\"The square of {num} is {num * num}\")\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat are different ways for describing what a \"for loop\" can do?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- for each item in a list, multiply it against itself.*\r\n- print the contents of a list.*\r\n- add a new item to a list.\r\n- loop through characters in a string.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [for loop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/for_loop.md)\r\n- [f-string](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/f-string.md)\r\n\r\n# Conditionals\r\n\r\nConditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs (consisting of book titles) based on the specified field of study. Type the following into the code editor below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\r\n\r\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\r\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nIn our first line, we set a variable `field` to the string `\"Media Studies\"`, representing our chosen field of study. The `if` statement checks whether the field is set to the string \"Media Studies\". If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the string `\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\"` will be printed.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note at this point the use of the double equals sign `==` in `if` statements. The double equals is an _equality_ operator, and it checks to see if the two values on either side are equivalent. Contrast this with the single equals that you've already seen, `=`, which is an _assignment_ operator, that assigns a value to a variable. In the line `field = \"Media Studies\"`, you are using the assignment operator `=` to set the variable's value to \"Media Studies\", (a string) while in the `if` statement, you're using the equality operator `==` to check if the field is equivalent to \"Media Studies\".\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice the inclusion of a new line, the `else` statement. The `else` statement handles any inputs that aren't \"Media Studies\", and the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring. You can think of `else` like a fail-safe that catches variables not directly accounted for.\r\n\r\nTry this script out both with the variable set to \"Media studies\" and the variable set to some other value, representing another field of study.\r\n\r\nWhat if we want our program to handle more fields of study, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first `if` statement are handled with `elif`, which is a shortened version of `else if`. Add the following code into the editor below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\r\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\r\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\r\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\r\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\r\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, if you were to change the `field` variable, you could run other blocks of code. You can add as many `elif` statements as you need, meaning that conditionals in Python have one `if` statement, any number of `elif` statements, and one `else` statement that catches any input not covered by `if` or `elif`. Over the next sections, we'll work on improving this little application, making it able to handle user input directly.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nAdd two more `elif` statements to the program to make it better able to handle different potential fields of study.

You can check your version by running `python --version` in the command line.\r\n\u003c/Info\u003e\r\n\r\n### Taking Input\r\n\r\nPython allows you to take input directly from the user using the `input()` function.\r\n\r\nLet's try it out by setting the function to a variable, which we will call `greeting`. In the REPL below, write the following line of code:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e greeting = input()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e, you should see a pop-up asking for input. Type in your favorite greeting. I'm going to type `hey you!`. Then, press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. \r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nNext, write `greeting` into the REPL. You should see something like the following appear:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e greeting = input()\r\ngreeting\r\nhey you!\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython has saved your input text to the variable `greeting`. When you type in `greeting`, it will print out that input text. Pretty nifty, right?\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e greeting = input()\r\nhey you!\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e greeting\r\n'hey you!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can play around with `input()` by adding some prompt text within the parenthesis. Whatever you put inside the parenthesis, enclosed by quotes, will prompt the user to type in their text, which is then assigned to the variable set to `input()`. Sounds complicated, so give it some practice with the REPL. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if we were to type the following:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can answer with `like a rollercoaster of emotions`. Then, when we type in our variable `feelings` and press enter, we'll get our input printed back at us. Note that there's a little space after the question mark and before the closing quotation mark, which is to improve readability.\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e feelings = input('How are you feeling today? ')\r\nHow are you feeling today? like a rollercoaster of emotions\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e feelings\r\n'like a rollercoaster of emotions'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nRemember this loop?\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nfield = \"Media Studies\"\r\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\r\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\r\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\r\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\r\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\r\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about! I'm just a little program...\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, that we understand a bit about how `input()` works, let's use it to improve our book application. We are going to use `input()` to ask for the field before displaying the output. To do this, add one more line of code in the editor above that sets the `field` variable to an `input()`. Make sure you include a little prompt that asks the user what book they want to select or read that day.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```python\r\nfield = input(\"Which field of study do you want to read about today? \")\r\n\r\nif field == \"Media Studies\":\r\n    print(\"Grammophone, Film, Typewriter\")\r\nelif field == \"Critical University Studies\":\r\n    print(\"The Undercommons\")\r\nelif field == \"Textual Scholarship\":\r\n    print(\"Radiant Textuality\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what field you're talking about!

Let's make our little book application a little more robust. We are going to create a list of books (remember lists?) that we can then manipulate in all sorts of ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, create a new list in the code editor with at least three books that are important to your research right now. Shorten the titles to one or two words if need be. Let's call this list our `library`. Remember the proper syntax for creating a list includes square brackets with commas separating the list items. Because the items are strings, they should also be inside quotes. For instance, your code might look something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nNext, let's sort our `library` in alphabetical order. There's a handy method called `sort()` for doing just this kind of thing. What's a _method_, you might ask? Well, _methods_ are very similar to _functions_, and you'll remember that functions are ways of doing things, like `print()` and `type()`. Methods are also ways of doing things, but these things are attached to what we call _objects_ in Python. Objects are part of object-oriented-programming, and that's definitely not necessary to learn right now. Suffice it to say that methods are just like functions, that is, they are ways of doing things to your data.\r\n\r\nTo sort the list, use the `sort()` method on your list that you created above. Your code should look like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nlibrary.sort()\r\nprint(library)\r\n```\r\nWhat happened here? Let's take it line by line. First, we created a list `library` with three items attached to it. Then, we applied the `sort()` method to the library list. Finally, we printed the `library`, which is now sorted in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nYou'll see that we have a couple of new things happening with symbols.\r\n- First, the period `.` which is an _operator_ in Python. The period operator is another part of object-oriented-programming, and it basically means that we are applying a task to whatever precedes the period. In this case, we are applying the `sort()` method to our `library` list. It's kind of like attaching a function to our `library`.\r\n- Second, we have the parenthesis `()` after `sort`. When you get more comfortable with programming, you'll often use the parentheses to include what we call _arguments_ that allows us to do more complex things to data. Let's see how an argument works with the `append()` method.\r\n\r\nWhat if we want to add items to the list? We can use the `append()` method for that. For instance, try the following:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nlibrary.append(\"La Frontera\")\r\nprint(library)\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nYou can see that we have added `\"La Frontera\"` as an argument to the `append()` method by putting the string between the parenthesis. It basically means that we will be appending this specific title to the library list.\r\n\r\nWhen you print `library`, you should see your new book appear at the end of the list. Pretty cool, right? Go ahead and add a couple more books to your list.\r\n\r\nWhat if you wanted to take out some of the books? We can use `pop()` to remove the last item, or \"pop\" it off, from our list.\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\", \"La Frontera\", \"Dawn\"]\r\nlibrary.pop()\r\nprint(library)\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nThe last item that you added to your list should be missing from the `library` when you print the list.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nRemember the `input()` function from the last lesson? This challenge uses that function in combination with what you know about list methods to create a little library app. You will play around with the input button, asking the user what kinds of things they want to do with their library, and writing some code that does those things and prints out the results.\r\n\r\nFirst, create a new file called `library.py`. Save it to your current working folder.\r\n\r\nSecond, create a list of `library` books, with at least three books (you can use the same ones as before).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, add an input statement that will save the user's response to a variable, like `response`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, create a conditional statement that matches the user's response to series of options for doing things to the `library` list. We'll let them sort the library (`sort()`), add new items (`append()`), and remove the last item (`pop()`). I'll do the first one, `sort()`, for you:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\nif response == \"sort\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nSee how the order of statements build on each other toward the final product? First, we create a library of books. Then, we set the user's response about what to do with those books. Then, we create a conditional statement that matches the response to specific tasks. The first condition checks to see if the user wants to \"sort\" the books, then sorts them, then prints the final result.\r\n\r\nNext, add `pop()` and `append()` to the program. \r\n\r\nAfter adding a few more conditions, test out your code! You should have a little library app that sorts, adds, and removes books from your list.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n```python\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\nif response == \"sort\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"add\":\r\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"remove\":\r\n    library.pop()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\r\n```\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nSelect the following statements that truly describe `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()`.\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- methods are like functions which are attached to objects.*\r\n- `sort()`, `append()`, and `pop()` are functions.\r\n- `append()` always takes an argument.*\r\n- `pop()` can be applied to a string.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n__Advanced question:__ If you `sort()` the library in between adding and popping a book, you'll end up with a different list than if you didn't run `sort()` in between `append()` and `pop()`. Can you guess why?\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [append](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/append.md)\r\n- [sort()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/sort.md)\r\n- [pop()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/pop.md)\r\n\r\n# Finding Answers with Google\r\n\r\nOur library app is working pretty well, but you may have noticed that it's case sensitive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat do you want to do with your books today?\r\nSort\r\nI don't know what you want me to do!\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow could we fix our program to handle cases like this? We could add a bunch of new `elif` statements, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nelif response == \"Sort\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"SORT\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like `SorT`. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our `if/else` block.\r\n\r\nEven if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So, let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.\r\n\r\nLet's try the search term [make string lowercase](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=make+string+lowercase+Python):\r\n\r\n![make string lower case Python Google search](/images/python/google_search.png)\r\n\r\nWhile Google searches change over time, some of your results likely come from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.\r\n\r\n![Google search results with stack overflow answer on top](/images/python/google_result.png)\r\n\r\nOn [this _Stack Overflow_ page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-do-i-lowercase-a-string-in-python), take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. Then scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for. You may also notice snarky debates—another \"feature\" of _Stack Overflow_.\r\n\r\n## Implementing Our Answer\r\n\r\nAccording to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding `.lower()` to the end of it, like this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e \"SORT\".lower()\r\n'sort'\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's incorporate this transformation into our library app:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\nresponse = response.lower()\r\nif response == \"sort\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"add\":\r\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"remove\":\r\n    library.pop()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nThis new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the response variable to a new value, `response.lower()`, which is a lowercase version of the original input.\r\n\r\nThere's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for _Stack Overflow_ answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing until you get the hang of reading documentation.\r\n\r\nBefore moving on to the next section, complete the first challenge below. This challenge will teach the skills necessary to complete write more advanced scripts in this workshop.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nLet's use a new type of loop, the `while` loop, to make our library app more interactive. We'll use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for input until they type `exit`.\r\n\r\nA typical `while` loop looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwhile condition:\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are going to use `while` loops to get Python to repeat loops over and over again. This involves adding a new variable to use as a condition, and a `while` statement. The code should look like this, and it goes right after the `library` list and before your `input` statement.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nuser_exit = False\r\nwhile user_exit == False:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that everything under `while True:` is indented (this creates a \"code block,\" or a group of lines that will be executed together). The `while` loop will keep running until the `user_exit` condition is no longer `False`. Our plan is to make it so that when the user types `exit`, the `user_exit` condition will be `True`, and the loop will stop running.\r\n\r\nGive it a shot! Try adding the condition and `while` loop to the program below:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\n# add a new variable condition and while loop here\r\nresponse = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\nresponse = response.lower()\r\nif response == \"sort\":\r\n    library.sort()\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"add\":\r\n    library.append(\"La Frontera\")\r\n    print(library)\r\nelif response == \"remove\":\r\n    library.pop()\r\n    print(library)\r\n# add an exit condition here\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nOnce you get the loop to work, you can add more `elif` statements to add more books to the list. Then, run the program, adding books, sorting them and removing them. You can read more about `while` loops [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nHere's how you would include a `while` statement in our library application:\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nlibrary = [\"Orlando\", \"Confessions of the Fox\", \"These Waves of Girls\"]\r\nuser_exit = False\r\nwhile user_exit == False:\r\n    response = input(\"What do you want to do with your books today? \")\r\n    response = response.lower()\r\n    if response == \"sort\":\r\n        library.sort()\r\n        print(library)\r\n    elif response == \"add\":\r\n        library.append(\"La Frontera\")\r\n        print(library)\r\n    elif response == \"remove\":\r\n        library.pop()\r\n        print(library)\r\n    elif response == \"exit\":\r\n        print(library)\r\n        user_exit = True\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"I don't know what you want me to do!\")\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nMake sure to type \"exit\" to end the program and view the results of your commands.\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to make a string like `'hello'` uppercase, we would use the method `upper()`, in the following way:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `upper('hello')`\r\n- `upper().'hello'`\r\n- `'hello'.upper()`*\r\n- `'hello'(upper)`\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [lower()](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lower.md)\r\n- [Method](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/method.md)\r\n\r\n# A Little Motivation\r\n\r\nEarly on, we learned a bit about lists, which look like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n[\"Gender Trouble\", \"Cruising Utopia\", \"Living a Feminist Life\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're going to create a small application that will print a random motivational saying every time a user presses \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. Our first step will be to create a list of positive sayings:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmotivational_phrases = [\r\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\r\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\r\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're still using the same list format. Remember lists open with a square bracket `[`, have items separated with commas, and end with a square bracket `]`, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, our positivity list above spreads the list out over multiple lines for greater readability, which is allowed in Python. Remember that you can change the strings in the list to whatever phrases you choose.\r\n\r\n## Importing a module\r\n\r\nNow that we have our sayings, let's use it in conjunction with some functionality from a module that's built into Python: the `random` module.\r\n\r\nFirst we need to __import__ the module.  In the code editor below, write the following line of code _above_ our motivational phrases...\r\n\r\n`import random`\r\n\r\n...and the following line of code _below_ our motivational phrases:\r\n\r\n`print(random.choice(motivational_phrases))`\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nmotivational_phrases = [\r\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\r\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\r\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\r\n    ]\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, each time you run the code, you should see a different motivational phrase as output. The `random.choice` function chooses a random item from a list and returns it. The `.` syntax indicates that the function is coming from the `random` library.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nThe real point of this section is to learn `import`, which is where Python really starts to get interesting. Python comes with many libraries (importable collections of code), written by others that can be pulled into your program, allowing you to use that functionality. In this challenge, do a little research on Python libraries that might solve a problem for you or address a domain that you're interested in.\r\n\r\nThink of something you're interested in doing (statistics, text analysis, web scraping, quantitative analysis, processing Excel/PDF/image files) and search google \"\u003c_thing you are interested in_\u003e python library\". You're almost certain to find some useful results. For example, if you wanted to find Python libraries for dealing with cleaning up HTML files, you might search one of these:\r\n\r\n\u003e working with html python library\r\n\r\n\u003e html parser python library\r\n\r\nIn your research, you may also want to look at the libraries that come with Python. You can find a list of libraries in these libraries [here](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhat is a module? Select all that apply:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- A module is a file of code.*\r\n- Applications can incorporate many different modules.*\r\n- A module needs to be downloaded and installed.\r\n- A module needs to be imported with an `import` statement.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Modules](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/module.md)\r\n- [Random](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/random.md)\r\n- [while loops](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/while_loop.md)\r\n\r\n# Objects in Python\r\n\r\nObjects in Python (and other programming languages) are basically containers that can hold data and/or functions inside them. When a function is inside an object, we usually call the function a \"method.\" When data is inside an object, we usually call it an \"attribute.\" The terminology isn't that important, though. What we do need to know is that you can access these \"methods\" and \"attributes\" with a `.` (a dot or period).\r\n\r\nWhen we added `sort()`, `append()`, `pop()`, and `lower()` to our library app, we briefly saw how some methods contained inside certain objects in Python, like Lists (for sort, append, and pop), and String objects, like lower.\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e loud_greeting = \"HELLO!\"\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e loud_greeting.lower()\r\n'hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany, or most, objects in Python have methods that allow you to use them in different ways. As you move into using more advanced Python, you'll find that understanding what methods are available becomes more important.\r\n\r\n## Examining Objects\r\n\r\nWhen you encounter an object, how can you learn its methods and attributes so you can use them? There are two main ways. The first, and likely the most practical, is to read the documentation of the library you're using.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can also use the `dir()` function, which will tell you which methods and attributes are available in an object.\r\n\r\nLet's use the REPL for a moment. First, type the following line:\r\n\r\n`\u003e\u003e\u003e s = 'Hello, world!'`\r\n\r\nThen, use the `dir()` function on `s`:\r\n\r\n`\u003e\u003e\u003e dir(s)`\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should get output like this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__',\r\n...\r\n'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above output shows some of the methods and attributes for Python strings that can be accessed using the dot (`.`) syntax. Also, be aware that Python doesn't print all the possible methods and attributes, just what it considers to be most important. Also, when using `dir()`, you'll mostly want to ignore the methods and attributes that have underscores around them. They mainly have to do with the internals of the Python language. For now, ignore the information within underscores (like `__add__`) and focus on the stuff surrouned by single quotes (like `startswith`).\r\n\r\nYou can also use `dir()` to see what functions are available from Python libraries that you import. Try importing the `random` library again and see what you get when you enter `dir(random)` in the REPL.\r\n\r\n\u003cPythonREPL/\u003e\r\n\r\nYou should see something like this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e import random\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e dir(random)\r\n['BPF', 'LOG4', 'NV_MAGICCONST', 'RECIP_BPF', 'Random', 'SG_MAGICCONST', 'SystemRandom', 'TWOPI', '_BuiltinMethodType', '_MethodType', '_Sequence', '_Set', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', '_acos', '_bisect', '_ceil', '_cos', '_e', '_exp', '_inst', '_itertools', '_log', '_os', '_pi', '_random', '_sha512', '_sin', '_sqrt', '_test', '_test_generator', '_urandom', '_warn', 'betavariate', 'choice', 'choices', 'expovariate', 'gammavariate', 'gauss', 'getrandbits', 'getstate', 'lognormvariate', 'normalvariate', 'paretovariate', 'randint', 'random', 'randrange', 'sample', 'seed', 'setstate', 'shuffle', 'triangular', 'uniform', 'vonmisesvariate', 'weibullvariate']\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry entering other objects based on Python types we've already learned to the `dir()` function. For example, you might try `dir([1, 2, 3])` to see what methods are available when using lists.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\n_Final Challenge_\r\n\r\nIn this final challenge, we will work more with the `random` library. We'll use the random library to create a basic dice rolling program that will give us a random number between 1 and 6.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the following code:\r\n\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nimport random\r\n# create a 'roll' function to return a random # between 1-6\r\ndef roll():\r\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\r\n# roll the die and print the results\r\nprint(f'You rolled a {roll()}.')\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\r\nFirst, we `import` the random library into our program. Then, we create a `roll` function that returns a random number between 1 and 6. We'll use the `randint` function from the random library to generate a random number. The `randint` function takes two arguments, the minimum and maximum number that can be returned. We'll use `1` and `6` for the minimum and maximum numbers to create a standard die. To get at our result, we `return` the outcome of the function. \r\n\r\nWe'll then `print` the result of `roll` to see exactly what number we rolled. To do so, we use the [`f` string formatting operator](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/). `f` strings easily allow us to format a string with variables. The `{}` is where we'll put the result of calling `roll`.\r\n\r\nIf you run this code, you should see a random number generated between 1 and 6.\r\n\r\n### Challenge\r\n\r\nStarting with the code above, roll the die twice, storing each result. Using both rolls, write a simple program that prints each roll and compares them. If the first roll is greater than the second, print \"First roll wins!\" If the second roll is greater than the first, print \"Second roll wins!\". If the rolls are equal, print \"Tie!\".\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n\u003cSecret\u003e\r\n\u003cCodeEditor\u003e\r\nimport random\r\n# create a 'roll' function to return a random # between 1-6\r\ndef roll():\r\n    return random.randint(1, 6)\r\ndie1 = roll()\r\ndie2 = roll()\r\nprint(f'The first roll is a {die1}.')\r\nprint(f'The second roll is a {die2}.')\r\nif die1 \u003e die2:\r\n    print('First roll wins!')\r\nelif die2 \u003e die1:\r\n    print('Second roll wins!')\r\nelse:\r\n    print('Tie!')\r\n\u003c/CodeEditor\u003e\r\n\u003c/Secret\u003e\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\nCongratulations on completing the Intro to Python workshop!

Rarely when I ask people \"what is data?\" do they respond \"_Moby Dick_.\" And yet, more and more, text is data. Whether it is _Moby Dick_, or every romance novel written since 1750, or today's newspaper or twitter feed, we are able to transform written (and spoken) language into data that can be quantified and visualized. That has been done for a while, but now we can do it in a much larger scale, in a much faster way.\r\n\r\n## Corpora\r\n\r\nThe first step in gathering insights from texts is to create a **corpus**. A corpus is a collection of texts that are somehow related to each other. For example, the [Corpus of Contemporary American English](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/), [Donald Trump's Tweets](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/), [text messages](https://byts.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) sent by bilingual young adults, [digitized newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/), or [books](https://www.gutenberg.org/) in the public domain are all corpora. There are infinitely many corpora, and, sometimes, you will want to make your own—that is, one that best fits your research question.\r\n\r\nThe route you take from here will depend on your research question. Let's say, for example, that you want to examine gender differences in writing style. Based on previous linguistic research, you hypothesize that male-identified authors use more definitives than female-identified. So you collect two corpora—one written by men, one written by women—and you count the number of *the*s, *this*s, and *that*s compared to the number of *a*s, *an*s, and *one*s. Maybe you find a difference, maybe you don't. We can already see that this is a relatively crude way of going about answering this question, but it is a start.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that, oftentimes our analysis of gender assumes pre-existing gender roles that reproduce gender as a binary system. Some digital humanists have pointed out that, if gender is binary, then the relation between male and female will likely be one of opposition. As [Laura Mandell](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/5d9c1b63-7b60-42dd-8cda-bde837f638f4#ch01) says, the categories of \"male\" and \"female\" are socially constructed, and quantitative analysis practitioners should avoid jumping to conclusions about \"male\" and \"female\" styles of thinking and writing \"as if the M/F terms were simple pointers to an unproblematic reality, transparently referential and not discursively constituted.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been some research about how the [linguistic complexity of written language](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/331/6014/176.full.pdf) in long-form pieces (i.e., books, articles, letters, etc.) has decreased over time. Simply put, people today use shorter sentences with fewer embedded clauses and complex tense constructions than people did in the past. (Note that this is not necessarily a bad or good thing.) Based on this research, we want to know if short-form platforms are emblematic of the change (we predict that they are based on our own experience with short-form platforms like email and Twitter). One way to do this would be to use Part-of-Speech tagging. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a way to identify the category of words in a given text.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sentence:\r\n\r\n\u003e I like the red bicycle.\r\n\r\nhas one pronoun, one verb, one determiner, one adjective, and one noun.\r\n\r\n\u003e (**I** : Pronoun), (**like** : Verb), (**the** : Determiner), (**red** : Adjective), (**bicycle** : Noun)\r\n\r\nNLTK uses the [Penn Tree Bank Tag Set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html). This is a very detailed tag list that goes far beyond just nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but gives insight into different types of nouns, prepositions, and verbs as well. Virtually all POS taggers will create a list of (word, POS) pairs. If newspaper articles have a higher ratio of function words (prepositions, auxiliaries, determiners, etc.) to semantic words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), than tweets, then we have one piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis. It's important to note here that we must use either ratios or otherwise normalized data (in the sense that raw numbers will not work). Because of the way that language works (function words are often repeated, for example), a sample of 100 words will have more unique words than a sample of 1,000. Therefore, to compare different data types (articles vs. tweets), this fact should be taken into account.\r\n\r\n## A Note About Languages\r\n\r\nEven though in this workshop we will use the English language in the examples, NLTK does support many other languages, due to amazing contributions from the Python Text Analysis community. The support, however, varies according to the desired task. Not all functions and tools will be available for all the supported languages. The good news is that the available tools keep growing in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning to work with other languages than English, you will have to figure out what tools are available and how to use them. Unfortunately, it is not something that can be fully explained in a general workshop like this. Some times it is as easy as changing `stopwords.words(\"English\")` (a command we will teach you later) to `stopwords.words(\"Spanish\")`. Occasionally, it will be harder than that. A search engine (Google, DuckDuckGo...) will be your best friend here.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich of the following sentences is correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- A text is not data in itself, but can produce data if converted into numbers.\r\n- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging can help identifying verbs, adjectives and nouns in a text.*\r\n- A corpus is any collection of texts, independently of being related to each other or not.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [NLTK](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/nltk.md)\r\n\r\n# Cleaning and Normalizing\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, our questions are more about topics rather than writing style. So, once we have a corpus—whether that is one text or millions—we usually want to clean and normalize it. There are three terms we are going to need:\r\n\r\n- **Text normalization** is the process of taking a list of words and transforming it into a more uniform sequence. Usually, this involves removing punctuation, making the words all the same case, removing _stop words_, and either _stemming_ or _lemmatizing_ the words. It can also include expanding abbreviations or matching misspellings (but these are advanced practices that we will not cover).\r\n\r\nYou probably know what removing punctuation and capitalization refer to, but the other terms may be new:\r\n\r\n- **Stop words** are words that appear frequently in a language, often adding grammatical structure, but little semantic content. There is no official list of stop words for any language, though there are some common, all-purpose lists built in to NLTK. However, different tasks require different lists. The purpose of removing stop words is to remove words that are so common that their meaning is diminished across a large number of texts.\r\n\r\n- **Stemming and lemmatizing** both of these processes try to consolidate words like \"laughs\" and \"laughing\" to  \"laugh\" since they all mean essentially the same thing, they are just inflected differently. So again, in an attempt to reduce the number of words, and get a realistic understanding of the meaning of a text, these words are collapsed. Stemming does this by cutting off the end (very fast), lemmatizing does this by looking up the dictionary form (very slow).\r\n\r\nLanguage is messy, and created for and by people, not computers. There is a lot of grammatical information in a sentence that a computer cannot use. For example, I could say to you:\r\n\r\n\u003e The house is burning.\r\n\r\nand you would understand me. You would also understand if I say\r\n\r\n\u003e house burn.\r\n\r\nThe first has more information about tense, and which house in particular, but the sentiment is the same either way.\r\n\r\nIn going from the first sentence to the normalized words, we removed the stop words (_the_ and _is_), and removed punctuation and case, and lemmatized what was left (_burning_ becomes _burn_—though we might have stemmed this, its impossible to tell from the example). This results in what is essentially a \"bag of words,\" or a corpus of words without any structure. Because normalizing your text reduces the number of words (and therefore the number of dimensions in your data), and keeps only the words that contribute meaning to the document, this cleaning is usually desirable.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important topic in Machine Learning tutorials. For the time being, we just need to know that there is \"clean\" and \"dirty\" versions of text data. Sometimes our questions are about the clean data, but sometimes our questions are in the \"dirt.\"\r\n\r\n## A Note on Ethics\r\n\r\nThe act of cleaning/normalizing subscribes text to predetermined categories of meaning, forcing meaning into existing \"boxes,\" so to speak. This doesn't mean that we should avoid cleaning or normalizing text, but that we should be aware of how some textual reductions have the potential to affect meaning. How does quantification reinforce differences or stratifications within our data? We have to be careful about the kinds of questions we are asking, and how we might be reproducing some of our assumptions in our inquiry.\r\n\r\nTo read more about ethics and text analysis, see Lauren Klein's \"[Distant Reading After Moretti](https://arcade.stanford.edu/blogs/distant-reading-after-moretti),\" where she questions, \"Instead of first asking what can be modeled—what phenomena we can track at scale—we might instead ask: what might be hidden in this corpus?”\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Stop words are useless for text analysis, therefore the first step in any project is to remove them from the text.\r\n- In any type of data analysis, we usually want to cleanse the data in order to prepare it for the analysis. In text analysis, this process is called \"text normalization\" and can involve tasks such as removing undesired words and punctuation.*\r\n- Textual alterations can potentially change the original intended meaning. Therefore, we must always strive to work with the data exactly as it is in the source.\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/machine-learning.md)\r\n- [Text Normalization](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/text-normalization.md)\r\n\r\n# Using the NLTK Corpus\r\n\r\nIn the following sections, we are going to learn how to work with the NLTK Corpus and go through a series of methods that come built-in to NLTK that allow us to turn our words into numbers and visualizations.\r\n\r\nAll of the code for this section is in a [Jupyter Notebook file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/text-analysis/v2.0/files/TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb). You should download it and save it on your desired folder. Here, we are assuming you are saving in in the `files` folder inside the `text-analysis` folder.\r\n\r\nIn this file you will find all of the workshop commands and the expected outputs. If you ever feel stuck or can't seem to be able to advance in the workshop, you can open this file and see how we did it. Feel free to open the file right now (click on it), take a peek at its contents if you want, and close it.\r\n\r\nTo do it, open your Jupyter Notebook, and navigate to the `files` folder inside the `text-analysis` folder. Click on the `TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb` file. Once you are done, just close the tab.\r\n\r\n![image of the Jupyter Notebook for this workshop](/images/text-analysis/TextAnalysisWalkthrough.png)\r\n\r\nFor the best possible experience, we suggest/encourage you to:\r\n- Create an `.ipynb` file and follow the workshop typing all the code yourself.\r\n- Avoid copying/pasting the code. Much of learning has to do with you typing yourself.\r\n- Only check the `TextAnalysisWalkthrough.ipynb` file if you get lost or if you are not able to get the right output. Before opening it, put some time trying to figure out by yourself why it isn't working. A big part of coding is learning to identify what we are doing wrong.\r\n- I would also caution you against working with both files open at the same time. It is easy to get confused and start modifying the wrong one.\r\n\r\nBut those are only suggestions. Maybe they will work for you, maybe they won't, so feel free to do as it best suit you. You are in charge here!\r\n\r\n## Creating a Jupyter Notebook File\r\n\r\nNow you will create your Jupyter notebook file, in which you will run the workshop. Return to the Jupyter Home Tab in your Browser (or, if you closed it completely, launch the Jupyter Notebook again), and start a New Python Notebook using the `New` button in the upper right corner.\r\n\r\nEven though Jupyter Notebook doesn't force you to do so, it is very important to name your file, or you will end up later with a bunch of untitled files and you will have no idea what they are about. In the top left, click in the word `Untitled` and give your file a name such as \"intro_nltk\".\r\n\r\n![image of a new jupyter notebook file](/images/text-analysis/change_title.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the first blank cell, type the following to import the NLTK library:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport nltk\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Libraries** are sets of instructions that Python can use to perform specialized functions. The Natural Language ToolKit (`nltk`) is one such library. As the name suggests, its focus is on language processing.\r\n\r\nWe will also need the `matplotlib` library later on, so import it now:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib\r\n```\r\n\r\n`matplotlib` is a library for making graphs. In the middle of this tutorial, we are going to make a dispersion plot of words in our texts.\r\n\r\nFinally, because of a quirk of Jupyter notebooks, we need to specify that `matplotlib` should display its graphs in the notebook (as opposed to in a separate window), so we type this command (this is technically a Jupyter command, not Python):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n%matplotlib inline\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three of these commands can be written in the same cell and run all at once (\u003ckbd\u003eshift\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e) or in different cells.\r\n\r\n![Image showing that the three lines given above can be written in a single cell in the Jupyter notebook, one after another](/images/text-analysis/imports.png)\r\n\r\nIf you don't see an error when you run the notebook—that is, if there is no output—you can move on to the next step. It is not rare in programming that when you do things right, the result will be nothing happening. This is what we like to call a _silent success_.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to load all of the NLTK corpora into our program. Even though we downloaded them to our computer, we need to tell Python we want to use them.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom nltk.book import *\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pre-loaded NLTK texts should appear again. These are preformatted data sets. We will still have to do some minor processing, but having the data in this format saves us a few steps. At the end of this tutorial, we will make our own corpus. This is a special type of python object specific to NLTK (it isn't a string, list, or dictionary). Sometimes it will behave like a string, and sometimes like a list of words.\r\n\r\n![Image showing a second cell with the output of \"from nltk.book import *\"](/images/text-analysis/nltkbook.png)\r\n\r\nNotice that each of the texts already have a variable name. _Moby Dick_ is `text1`, _Sense and Sensibility_ is `text2`, and so on. When we want to work with those books, we will call them by their variable name, as you'll see soon.\r\n\r\nIf you got any error messages, check the code and make sure you typed everything correctly. Even spaces before words matter!\r\n\r\nIf you are sure you are running the code correctly, you probably have an installing issue, so you might have to go back to the installation instructions to figure it out.\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Corpus](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/corpus.md)\r\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/jupyter-notebook.md)\r\n- [Library](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/library.md)\r\n- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/matplotlib.md)\r\n\r\n# Searching for Words\r\n\r\nLet's start by analyzing _Moby Dick_, which is `text1` for NLTK.\r\n\r\nThe first function we will look at is `concordance`. \"Concordance\" in this context means the characters on either side of the word. Our text is behaving like one giant string, so concordance will just count the number of characters on either side. By default, this is 25 characters on either side of our target word (including spaces), but [you can change that if you want](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/text.html#Text.concordance).\r\n\r\nIn the Jupyter Notebook, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.concordance(\"whale\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output shows us the 25 characters on either side of the word \"whale\" in _Moby Dick_. Let's try this with another word, \"love.\" Just replace the word \"whale\" with \"love,\" and we get the contexts in which Melville uses \"love\" in _Moby Dick_. `concordance` is used (behind the scenes) for several other functions, including `similar` and `common_contexts`.\r\n\r\nLet's now see which words appear in similar contexts as the word \"love.\" NLTK has a built-in function for this as well: `similar`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.similar(\"love\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, Python found all the contexts where the word \"love\" appears. It also finds similar environments, and then what words were common among the similar contexts. This gives a sense of what other words appear in similar contexts. This is somewhat interesting in itself, but more interesting if we compare it to something else. Let's take a look at another text. What about _Sense and Sensibility_ (`text2`)? Let's see what words are similar to \"love\" in Jane Austen's writing. In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext2.similar(\"love\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can compare the two and see immediately that Melville and Austen use the word \"love\" differently.\r\n\r\n## Investigating \"lol\"\r\n\r\nLet's expand from novels for a minute and take a look at the NLTK Chat Corpus. In chats, text messages, and other digital communication platforms, \"lol\" is exceedingly common. We know it doesn't simply mean \"laughing out loud\"—maybe the `similar` function can provide some insight into what it does mean.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext5.similar(\"lol\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting list is a lot of greetings, indicating that \"lol\" probably has more of a [phatic function](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100321840). Phatic language is language primarily for communicating social closeness. Phatic words stand in contrast to semantic words, which contribute meaning to the utterance.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this type of analysis, take a look at the `common_contexts` function in the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) or in the [NLTK docs](https://www.nltk.org/).\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- The similar method brings a list of words that are similar in writing, but not necessarily in meaning, like \"whale\" and \"while\".\r\n- Using the `concordance` method with a specific word, such as \"whale\", returns the words that surround \"whale\" in different sentences, helping us to get a glimpse of the contexts in which the word \"whale\" shows up.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Concordance](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/concordance.md)\r\n- [Phatic Language](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/phatic-language.md)\r\n\r\n# Positioning Words\r\n\r\nIn many ways, `concordance` and `similar` are heightened word searches that tell us something about what is happening near the target words. Another metric we can use is to visualize where the words appear in the text. In the case of _Moby Dick_, we want to compare where \"whale\" and \"monster\" appear throughout the text. In this case, the text is functioning as a list of words, and will make a mark where each word appears, offset from the first word. We will _pass_ this _function_ a _list_ of _strings_ to plot. In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.dispersion_plot([\"whale\", \"monster\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nA graph should appear with a tick mark everywhere that \"whale\" appears and everywhere that \"monster\" appears. Knowing the story, we can interpret this graph and align it to what we know of how the narrative progresses, helping us develop a visual of the story — where the whale goes from being a whale to being a monster to being a whale again. If we did not know the story, this could give us hints of the narrative arc.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nTry this with `text2`, _Sense and Sensibility_, [as we saw here](#downloading-the-corpus). Some relevant words are \"marriage,\" \"love,\" \"home,\" \"mother,\" \"husband,\" \"sister,\" and \"wife.\" Pick a few to compare. You can compare an unlimited number, but it's easier to read a few at a time. (Note that the comma in our writing here is _inside_ the quotation mark, because that is how proper English grammar works. However, in Python, you would have to put commas _outside_ of the quotation marks to create a _list_.)\r\n\r\nNLTK has many more functions built-in, but some of the most powerful functions are related to cleaning, part-of-speech tagging, and other stages in the text analysis pipeline (where the pipeline refers to the process of loading, cleaning, and analyzing text).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext2.dispersion_plot([\"love\", \"marriage\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext2.dispersion_plot([\"husband\", \"wife\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- You can get a visual representation of occurrences of a word with the `dispersion_plot` method.*\r\n- The `dispersion_plot` method allows you to input a list of strings, as long as you split them with commas.*\r\n- Contrary to grammar rule, in a list of strings, the commas must come outside of the quotation marks.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Types vs. Tokens\r\n\r\nWe will now turn our attention away from the NLTK library and work with our text using the _built-in Python functions_, the ones that come included with the Python language, rather than the NLTK library. (This difference is relevant because built-in python functions will work with any list of strings, while some of the functions that are specific to the NLTK library will require you to make your text \"nltk ready\". Don't worry about that now, we will show you how to do it later in this workshop).\r\n\r\nFirst, let's find out how many times a given word appears in the corpus. In this case (and all cases going forward), our text will be treated as a list of words. Therefore, we will use the `count` function. We could just as easily do this with a text editor, but performing this in Python allows us to save it to a variable and then utilize this statistic in other calculations (for example, if we want to know what percentage of words in a corpus are 'lol', we would need a count of the 'lol's). In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.count(\"whale\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see that \"whale\" occurs 906 times, but that seems a little low. Let's check the same thing, but now for \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\":\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.count(\"Whale\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1.count(\"WHALE\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is clear here is that the `count` method is case-sensitive.\r\n\"Whale\" with a capital \"W\" appears 282 times, and \"WHALE\" another 38 times. Depending on the type of analysis, this distinction can be a problem, and we might want \"whale\", \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\" to be collapsed into one single word. We will deal with that in a moment. For the time being, we will accept that we have three different entries for \"whale.\"\r\n\r\nThis gets at a distinction between **type** and **token**. \"Whale\" and \"whale\" are different types (as of now) because they do not match identically. Every instance of \"whale\" in the corpus is another **token**—it is an instance of the type, \"whale.\" Therefore, there are 906 tokens of \"whale\" in our corpus, 282 tokens of \"Whale\" and 38 tokens of \"WHALE\".\r\n\r\nBut that's not what we want. Let's fix this by making all of the words lowercase. We will make a new list of words, and call it `text1_tokens`. We will fill this list with all the words in `text1`, but in their lowercase form. Python has a built-in function, `lower()` that takes all letters and makes them lowercase. In this same step, we are going to do a kind of tricky move, and only keep the words that are alphabetical and pass over anything that is punctuation or numbers. There is a built-in function, `isalpha()`, that will allow us to save only those words that are made of letters. If `isalpha()` is true, we'll make the word lowercase, and keep the word. If not, we'll pass over it and move to the next one.\r\n\r\nType the following code into a new cell in your notebook. Pay special attention to the indentation, which must appear as below. (Note that in Jupyter Notebook, indentation usually comes automatically. If not, make sure to type the \u003ckbd\u003espace\u003c/kbd\u003e key 4 times)\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_tokens = []\r\nfor t in text1:\r\n    if t.isalpha():\r\n        t = t.lower()\r\n        text1_tokens.append(t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf everything went right, you should get no output. Remember the \"silent success?\"\r\n\r\nAnother way to perform the same action more tersely is to use what's called a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). A list comprehension is a shorter, faster way to write a for-loop. It is syntactically a little more difficult to read (for a human), but, in this case, it's much faster to process.\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much about understanding the syntax of list comprehensions right now, just try to recognize on it the elements you've seen in the for loop. For every example, we will show both the for loop and list comprehension options so you can slowly get used to the latter.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_tokens = [t.lower() for t in text1 if t.isalpha()]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Take a Breath\r\n\r\nLet's take a breath, because this was a difficulty spike. For loops are weird and not super intuitive. It usually takes some time for us to get used to them.\r\n\r\nI suggest going back to the loop above, review it, try to understand why all indentations are where they are.\r\n\r\nFeel like you understand it? Try deleting it and writing the loop yourself without looking at this guide.\r\n\r\nYou can also copy the whole loop to a new jupyter notebook cell and play around with it. What happens when you change the order of the commands? How about the indentation? Don't be afraid to break it.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like you are done playing with the loop, time to move to the next section to see the results.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- \"Whale\", \"WHALE\", and \"whale\" are all different tokens of the same type.\r\n- The `lower()` method returns the lowercase form of all of the alphabetical characters in a string.*\r\n- The `isalpha()` method transforms integers in alphabetical strings.\r\n- The `append()` method adds an item to the end of the list.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Token](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/token.md)\r\n- [Tokenizing](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tokenizing.md)\r\n- [Type](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/type.md)\r\n\r\n# Length and Unique Words\r\n\r\nGreat! Now `text1_tokens` is a list of all of the tokens in our corpus, with the punctuation removed, and all the words in lowercase. Let's check it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_tokens.count(\"whale\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now we have 1226 tokens for \"whale\", which is the exact some of the counts we did before. To double check, count \"Whale\" and \"WHALE\" again and you should see no results for them.\r\n\r\nNow we want to know how many words there are in our corpus—that is, how many tokens in total. Therefore, we want to ask, \"What is the length of that list of words?\" Python has a built-in `len` function that allows you to find out the length of many types. Pass it a list, and it will tell you how many items are in the list. Pass it a string, and it will tell you how many characters are in the string. Pass it a dictionary, and it will tell you how many items are in the dictionary. In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(text1_tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust for comparison, check out how many words were in `text1`—before we removed the punctuation and the numbers.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(text1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe see there are over 218,000 words in _Moby Dick_ (including metadata). But this is the number of words total—we want to know the number of unique words. That is, we want to know how many _types_, not just how many tokens.\r\n\r\nIn order to get unique words, rather than just all words in general, we will make a **set** from the list. A `set` in Python works just like it would [in math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), it's all the unique values, with any duplicate items removed.\r\n\r\nSo let's find out the length of our set. just like in math, we can also nest our functions. So, rather than saying `x = set(text1_tokens)` and then finding the length of \"x\", we can do it all in one step.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(set(text1_tokens))\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Lexical Density\r\n\r\nNow we can calculate the **lexical density**, the number of unique words per total words. [Statistical studies](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2a8/56959d7f5880c98ccd4cfeb4b4f5b7133ec7.pdf) have shown that lexical density is a good metric to approximate lexical diversity—the range of vocabulary an author uses. For our first pass at lexical density, we will simply divide the number of unique words by the total number of words:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(set(text1_tokens)) / len(text1_tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to use this metric to compare texts, we immediately notice a problem. Lexical density is dependent upon the length of a text and therefore is strictly a comparative measure. It is possible to compare 100 words from one text to 100 words from another, but because language is finite and repetitive, it is not possible to compare 100 words from one to 200 words from another. Even with these restrictions, lexical density is a useful metric in grade level estimations, [vocabulary use](http://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/2/3/7) and genre classification, and a reasonable proxy for lexical diversity.\r\n\r\nLet's take this constraint into account by working with only the first 10,000 words of our text. First we need to slice our list, returning the words in position 0 to position 9,999 (we'll actually write it as \"up to, but not including\" 10,000).\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_slice = text1_tokens[0:10000]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can do the same calculation we did above:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(set(text1_slice)) / len(text1_slice)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a much higher number, though the number itself is arbitrary. When comparing different texts, this step is essential to get an accurate measure.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nLet's compare the lexical density of _Moby Dick_ with _Sense and Sensibility_. Make sure to:\r\n\r\n1. Make all the words lowercase and remove punctuation.\r\n2. Make a slice of the first 10,000 words.\r\n3. Calculate lexical density by dividing the length of the set of the slice by the length of the slice.\r\n\r\nRemember to be aware of the ethical implications for the conclusions that we might draw about our data. What assumptions might we be reifying about these writers?\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext2_tokens = []\r\nfor t in text2:\r\n    if t.isalpha():\r\n        t = t.lower()\r\n        text2_tokens.append(t)\r\n\r\ntext2_slice = text2_tokens[0:10000]\r\n\r\nlen(set(text2_slice)) / len(text2_slice)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- The `len` method returns the length of the input, which can mean different things depending on its type. If it is a string, it will return the number of characters; if it is a list or dictionary, it will return the number of items.*\r\n- The lexical density measures the number of unique words per total word, and it is an objective measure of writing quality.\r\n- Comparing the lexical density between texts of different sizes can give a problematic result. A possible solution is to use list slice and compare parts of both texts of a similar size.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n# Data Cleaning: Removing Stop Words\r\n\r\nThus far, we have been asking questions that take stop words and grammatical features into account. For the most part, we want to exclude these features since they don't actually contribute very much semantic content to our models. Therefore, we will:\r\n\r\n1. Remove capitalization and punctuation (we've already done this).\r\n2. Remove stop words.\r\n3. Lemmatize (or stem) our words, i.e. \"jumping\" and \"jumps\" become \"jump.\"\r\n\r\nWe already completed step one, and are now working with our `text1_tokens`. Remember, this variable, `text1_tokens`, contains a list of strings that we will work with. We want to remove the stop words from that list. The NLTK library comes with fairly comprehensive lists of stop words for many languages. Stop words are function words that contribute very little semantic meaning and most often have grammatical functions. Usually, these are function words such as determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, and others.\r\n\r\nTo use NLTK's stop words, we need to import the list of words from the corpus. (We could have done this at the beginning of our program, and in more fully developed code, we would put it up there, but this works, too.) In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to specify the English list, and save it into its own variable that we can use in the next step:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nstops = stopwords.words('english')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's take a look at those words:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(stops)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we want to go through all of the words in our text, and if that word is in the stop words list, remove it from our list. Otherwise, we want it to skip it. (The code below is slow, so it may take some time to process). The way we can write this in Python is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_stops = []\r\nfor t in text1_tokens:\r\n    if t not in stops:\r\n        text1_stops.append(t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA faster option, if you are feeling bold, would be using list comprehension:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_stops = [t for t in text1_tokens if t not in stops]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo check the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(text1_stops[:30])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying List Contents\r\n\r\nNow that we removed our stop words, let's see how many words are left in our list:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(text1_stops)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a much lower number.\r\n\r\nFor reference, let's also check how many unique words there are. We will do this by making a set of words. Sets are the same in Python as they are in math, they are all of the unique words rather than all the words. So, if \"whale\" appears 200 times in the list of words, it will only appear once in the set.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(set(text1_stops))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Stop words are words that usually don't contribute with much semantic content, like prepositions, determiners, etc.*\r\n- To use stop words we need to import them from the nltk corpus, using the following code: `import stopwords from nltk.corpus`\r\n- List comprehensions are faster ways of iterating and creating lists when compared with for loops.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Stop Words](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/stop-words.md)\r\n\r\n# Data Cleaning: Lemmatizing Words\r\n\r\nNow that we've removed the stop words from our corpus, the next step is to stem or lemmatize the remaining words. This means that we will strip off the grammatical structure from the words. For example, `cats ⭢ cat`, and `walked ⭢ walk`. If that was all we had to do, we could stem the corpus and achieve the correct result, because stemming (as the name implies) really just means cutting off affixes to find the root (or the stem). Very quickly, however, this gets complicated, such as in the case of `men ⭢ man` and `sang ⭢ sing`. Lemmatization deals with this by looking up the word in a reference and finding the appropriate root (though note that this still is not entirely accurate). Lemmatization, therefore, takes a relatively long time, since each word must be looked up in a reference. NLTK comes with pre-built stemmers and lemmatizers.\r\n\r\nWe will use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK Stem library, so let's import that now:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the way that it is written \"under the hood,\" an instance of the lemmatizer needs to be called. We know this from reading [the docs](https://www.nltk.org/).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's quickly see what lemmatizing does.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"children\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow try this one:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"better\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt didn't work, but...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"better\", pos='a')\r\n```\r\n\r\n... sometimes we can get better results if we define a specific part of speech(pos). \"a\" is for \"adjective\", as we learned [here](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/wordnet.html).\r\n\r\nNow we will lemmatize the words in the list.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_clean = []\r\nfor t in text1_stops:\r\n    t_lem = wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t)\r\n    text1_clean.append(t_lem)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again, there is a faster version for you to use once you feel comfortable with list comprehensions:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext1_clean = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in text1_stops]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying Clean List Contents\r\n\r\nLet's check now to see the length of our final, cleaned version of the data, and then check the unique set of words. Notice how we will use the `print` function this time. Jupyter Notebook does print commands without the `print` function, but it will only print one thing per cell (the last command), and we wanted to print two different things:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(len(text1_clean))\r\nprint(len(set(text1_clean)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf everything went right, you should have the same length as before, but a smaller number of unique words. That makes sense since we did not remove any word, we only changed some of them.\r\n\r\nNow if we were to calculate lexical density, we would be looking at how many word stems with semantic content are represented in _Moby Dick_, which is a different question than the one in our first analysis of lexical density.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you try that by yourself? Try to remember how to calculate lexical density without looking back first. It is ok if you have forgotten.\r\n\r\nNow let's have a look at the words Melville uses in _Moby Dick_. We'd like to look at all of the _types_, but not necessarily all of the _tokens._ We will order this set so that it is in an order we can handle. In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsorted(set(text1_clean))[:30]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sorted` combined with `set` should give us a list of all the unique words in _Moby Dick_ in alphabetical order, but we only want to see the first ones. Notice how there are some words we wouldn't have expected, such as 'abandon', 'abandoned', 'abandonedly', and 'abandonment'. This process is far from perfect, but it is useful. However, depending on your goal, a different process, like _stemming_ might be better.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Stemming and lemmatizing are different forms of reducing word variations to their roots.*\r\n- `sorted(set(list_of_strings))` returns the unique items of `list_of_strings` in alphabetical order.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Lemmatization](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lemmatization.md)\r\n- [Lexical Density](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/lexical-density.md)\r\n\r\n# Data Cleaning: Stemming Words\r\n\r\nThe code to implement this and view the output is below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\r\nporter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Porter is the most common Stemmer. Let's see what stemming does to words and compare it with lemmatizers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('berry'))\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('berries'))\r\nprint(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize('berry'))\r\nprint(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize('berries'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nStemmer doesn't look so good, right? But how about checking how stemmer handles some of the words that our lemmatized \"failed\" us?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandon'))\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandoned'))\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandonedly'))\r\nprint(porter_stemmer.stem('abandonment'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill not perfect, but a bit better. So the question is, how to choose between stemming and lemmatizing? As many things in text analysis, that depends. The best way to go is experimenting, seeing the results and choosing the one that better fits your goals.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, stemming is faster while lemmatizing is more accurate (but not always, as we just saw). For academics, usually the choice goes for the latter.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let's stem our text with the Porter Stemmer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nt1_porter = []\r\nfor t in text1_clean:\r\n    t_stemmed = porter_stemmer.stem(t)\r\n    t1_porter.append(t_stemmed)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if we want a faster way:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nt1_porter = [porter_stemmer.stem(t) for t in text1_clean]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd let's check the results:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(len(set(t1_porter)))\r\nprint(sorted(set(t1_porter))[:30])\r\n```\r\n\r\nA very different list of words is produced. This list is shorter than the list produced by the lemmatizer, but is also less accurate, and some of the words will completely change their meaning (like 'berry' becoming 'berri').\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- Both Stemming and Lemmatizing are far from perfect, so they must be used with caution.*\r\n- There is no obvious best choice between Stemmers and Lemmatizers, so the best way to go is experimenting and seeing what results better fit your goals.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Stemming](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/stemming.md)\r\n\r\n# Data Cleaning: Results\r\n\r\nNow that we've seen some of the differences between both, we will proceed using our lemmatized corpus, which we saved as `text1_clean`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_dist = FreqDist(text1_clean)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf nothing happened, that is normal. Check to make sure it is there by calling for the type of the \"my_dist\" object.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntype(my_dist)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result should say it is a nltk probability distribution (`nltk.probability.FreqDist`). It doesn't matter too much right now what that is, only that it worked. We can now plot this with `matplotlib`'s function called `plot`. We want to plot the first 20 entries of the `my_dist` object.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_dist.plot(20)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![nltk plot distribution](/images/text-analysis/nltk_plot.png)\r\n\r\nWe've made a nice image here, but it might be easier to comprehend as a list. Because this is a special probability distribution object we can call the `most_common` on this, too. Let's find the twenty most common words:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_dist.most_common(20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat about if we are interested in a list of specific words—perhaps to identify texts that have biblical references. Let's make a (short) list of words that might suggest a biblical reference and see if they appear in _Moby Dick_. Set this list equal to a variable:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nb_words = ['god', 'apostle', 'angel']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we will loop through the words in our cleaned corpus, and see if any of them are in our list of biblical words. We'll then save into another list just those words that appear in both.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_list = []\r\nfor word in b_words:\r\n    if word in text1_clean:\r\n        my_list.append(word)\r\n    else:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then we will print the results.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(my_list)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can obviously do this with much larger lists and even compare entire novels if you wish, though it would take a while with this approach. You can use this to get similarity measures and answer related questions.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\n1. Try to get the same result of the loop above (the one with \"my_list\"), but this time with a list comprehension. Save this other list as \"my_list2\".\r\n\r\n2. Compare both lists to see if they are identical.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. A solution using a list comprehension would look like this:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    my_list2 = [word for word in b_words if word in text1_clean]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. To compare the lists, you could run the following command:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    my_list == my_list2\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich one of the following sentences is correct:\r\n\r\n- We can create a frequency distribution of a list of strings with `FreqDist` and plot it with the `plot` method.*\r\n- `my_dist.most_common(50)` will check the first 50 words in the distribution and return you the most common one among them.\r\n\r\n# Make Your Own Corpus\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen and implemented a series of text analysis techniques, let's go to the Internet to find a new text. You could use something such as historic newspapers, or Supreme Court proceedings, or use any txt file on your computer. Here we will use [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org). Project Gutenberg is an archive of public domain written works, available in a wide variety of formats, including `.txt`. You can download these to your computer or access them via the url. We'll use the latter. We found _Don Quixote_ in the archive (see [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt)), and will work with that.\r\n\r\nThe Python package `urllib` comes installed with Python, but is inactive by default, so we still need to import it to utilize the functions. Since we are only going to use the `urlopen` function, we will just import that one.\r\n\r\nIn the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `urlopen` function allows your program to interact with files on the internet by opening them. It does not read them, however—they are just available to be read in the next line. This is the default behavior any time a file is opened and read by Python. One reason is that you might want to read a file in different ways. For example, if you have a _really_ big file—think big data—you might want to read line-by-line rather than the whole thing at once.\r\n\r\nNow let's specify which URL we are going to use. Though you might be able to find _Don Quixote_ in the Project Gutenberg files, please type this in so that we are all using the same format (there are multiple `.txt` files on the site, one with utf-8 encoding, another with ascii encoding). We want the utf-8 encoded one. The difference between these is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can check out this [introduction to character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding) from The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) if you are interested.\r\n\r\nSet the URL we want to a variable:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_url = \"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996-0.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe still need to open the file and read the file. You will have to do this with files stored locally as well. (in which case, you would type the path to the file (i.e., `data/texts/mytext.txt`) in place of `my_url`)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfile = urlopen(my_url)\r\n\r\nraw = file.read()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is in bytes, so we need to decode it into a string. In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndon = raw.decode()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's check on what kind of object we have in the \"don\" variable. Type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntype(don)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be a string. Great! We have just read in our first file.\r\n\r\n# Make Your Own Corpus (continued)\r\n\r\nNow we are going to transform that string into a text that we can perform NLTK functions on. Since we already imported nltk at the beginning of our program, we don't need to import it again, we can just use its functions by specifying `nltk` before the function. The first step is to tokenize the words, transforming the giant string into a list of words. A simple way to do this would be to split on spaces, and that would probably be fine, but we are going to use the NLTK tokenizer to ensure that edge cases are captured (i.e., \"don't\" is made into 2 words: \"do\" and \"n't\"). In the next cell, type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndon_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(don)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check out the type of `don_tokens` using the `type()` function to make sure it worked—it should be a list. Let's see how many words there are in our novel:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlen(don_tokens)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this is a list, we can look at any slice of it that we want. Let's inspect the first ten words:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndon_tokens[:10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat looks like metadata—not what we want to analyze. We will strip this off before proceeding. If you were doing this to many texts, you would want to use [Regular Expressions](https://regexone.com/). Regular Expressions are an extremely powerful way to match text in a document. However, we are just using this text, so we could either guess, or cut and paste the text into a text reader and identify the position of the first content (i.e., how many words in is the first word). That is the route we are going to take. We found that the content begins at word 320, so let's make a slice of the text from word position 320 to the end.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndq_text = don_tokens[320:]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow print the first 30 words to see if it worked:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(dq_text[:30]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, if we want to use the NLTK specific functions:\r\n\r\n- `concordance`\r\n- `similar`\r\n- `dispersion_plot`\r\n- or others from the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/)\r\n\r\nwe would have to make a specific NLTK `Text` object.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndq_nltk_text = nltk.Text(dq_text)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we could check that it worked by running:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntype(dq_nltk_text)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if we only need to use the built-in Python functions, we can just stick with our list of words in `dq_text`.\r\n\r\n## Challenge\r\n\r\nUsing the `dq_text` variable:\r\n\r\n- Remove the stop words\r\n- Remove punctuation\r\n- Remove capitalization\r\n- Lemmatize the words\r\n\r\nIf you want to spice your challenge up, do the first three operations _in a single if statement_. Google \"python nested if statements\" for examples.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. Lowercase, remove punctuation and stop words:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    dq_clean = []\r\n    for word in dq_text:\r\n        if word.isalpha():\r\n            if word.lower() not in stops:\r\n                dq_clean.append(word.lower())\r\n    print(dq_clean[:50])\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Lemmatize:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\r\n    wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\r\n\r\n    dq_lemmatized = []\r\n    for t in dq_clean:\r\n        dq_lemmatized.append(wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nCheck all sentences below that are correct:\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- `urlopen` can save the contents of a webpage into a variable.*\r\n- To use NLTK functions on a string, we can transform it into a NLTK Text object.*\r\n- NLTK let's you tokenize (split) a giant string into a list of substrings, considering punctuations and edge cases like `don't`.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [Metadata](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/metadata.md)\r\n- [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/regular-expressions.md)\r\n\r\n# Part-of-Speech Tagging\r\n\r\n_Note that we are going to use the pre-cleaned, `dq_text` object for this section._\r\n\r\nPOS (Part-of-Speech) tagging is going through a text and identifying which part of speech each word belongs to (i.e., Noun, Verb, or Adjective). Every word belongs to a part of speech, but some words can be confusing.\r\n\r\n- Floyd is happy.\r\n- Happy is a state of being.\r\n- Happy has five letters.\r\n- I'm going to Happy Cat tonight.\r\n\r\nTherefore, part of speech is as much related to the word itself as its relationship to the words around it. A good part-of-speech tagger takes this into account, but there are some impossible cases as well:\r\n\r\n- Wanda was entertaining last night.\r\n\r\nPart of Speech tagging can be done very simply: with a very small _tag set_, or in a very complex way: with a much more elaborate tag set. We are going to implement a compromise, and use a neither small nor large tag set, the [Penn Tree Bank POS Tag Set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html).\r\n\r\nThis is the tag set that is pre-loaded into NLTK. When we call the tagger, we expect it to return an object with the word and the tag associated. Because POS tagging is dependent upon the stop words, we have to use a text that includes the stop words. Therefore, we will go back to using the `dq_text` object for this section. Let's try it out. Type:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndq_tagged = nltk.pos_tag(dq_text)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's inspect what we have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(dq_tagged[:10])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a list of ordered _tuples_. The Python native type _tuple_ is similar to a list, but can't be changed once it is created. They are also denoted with parentheses, rather than square brackets. Each element in the list is a tuple—or a pairing—consisting of `(word, POS-tag)`. This is great, but it is very detailed. I would like to know how many nouns, verbs, and adjectives I have.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'll make an empty dictionary to hold my results. (If you don't know what a dictionary is and how they work, you can check a quick explanation [here](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/).) After that, I will go through this list of tuples and count the number of times each tag appears. Every time I encounter a new tag, I'll add it to a dictionary and then increment by one every time I encounter that tag again. Let's see what that looks like in code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntag_dict = {}\r\n\r\n# For every word/tag pair in my list,\r\nfor (word, tag) in dq_tagged:\r\n    if tag in tag_dict:\r\n        tag_dict[tag]+=1\r\n    else:\r\n        tag_dict[tag] = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's see what we got:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntag_dict\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be better with some order to it, but dictionaries are made to be unordered. When we google \"sort dictionaries python\" we find a solution in our great friend [_Stack Overflow_](https://stackoverflow.com/a/613218). Even though we cannot sort a dictionary, we can get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted.\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much about understanding the following code, as it uses functions and methods we have not discussed, and are out of the scope of this course. It is useful to learn to reuse pieces of code even when we don't fully understand them.\r\n\r\nNow let's do it and find out what the most common tag is.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntag_dict_sorted = sorted(tag_dict.items(),\r\n\t\t\t reverse=True,\r\n\t\t\t key=lambda kv: kv[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's check out what we have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(tag_dict_sorted)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour result should show that NN is the most common tag. We can look up what NN means in the [Penn Tree Bank](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html). Looks like NN is a Noun, singular or mass. Great! This information will likely help us with genre classification, or identifying the author of a text, or a variety of other functions.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation\r\n\r\nWhich of the following are correct?\r\n\r\n\u003cQuiz\u003e\r\n- POS tagging does not work well with stop words, therefore you should always clean your text from stop words before using it.\r\n- Tuples are like lists, but you can't change their value once created.*\r\n- `nltk.pos_tag` returns tuples of two values, the first being the word, and the second the tag.*\r\n\u003c/Quiz\u003e\r\n\r\n## Keywords\r\n\r\nDo you remember the glossary terms from this section?\r\n\r\n- [part-of-speech (POS) tagging](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/part-of-speech.md)\r\n- [Dictionaries](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/dictionaries.md)\r\n- [Tuples](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/glossary/blob/v2.0/terms/tuples.md)\r\n\r\n# Theory to Practice\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You are done with the Text Analysis workshop!  \r\n  \r\nAs you may expect, this course was only the beginning of your journey. NLTK is a vast and ever expanding world. The possibilities are numerous, with exciting new things coming everyday.  \r\n  \r\nOur goal was to show some of those possibilities, and equip you with enough tools/knowledge/skills to be able to keep advancing. In this page we suggest you further readings and other tutorials for which we feel you might be ready. Don't be afraid to try! It is also useful to come back to this workshop with fresh eyes after a while. It will help you solidify some of the knowledge and make some things more clear.  \r\n  \r\nHave a happy journey!\r\n\r\n## Review your knowledge: 10 questions from the lessons\r\n\r\n__1.

Firefox allows users to access websites on the internet. \r\n\r\n## Why we use it\r\n\r\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Firefox because it works on Windows and Mac operating systems, it is frequently updated, and it values user privacy. \r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: macOS\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Go to the Firefox download webpage\r\n\r\nVisit the [Firefox download page](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=support.mozilla.org) in your pre-installed browser, such as Safari.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the Firefox download page for Mac](/images/guides/firefox_mac_01.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Download Firefox Installer\r\n\r\nClick on the `Download Firefox` button.\r\n\r\n![Image showing where to click to download Firefox](/images/guides/firefox_mac_02.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Move Firefox to the Applications folder\r\n\r\nOnce the download has finished, the file should open by itself and pop open a Finder window containing the Firefox application. Drag the Firefox icon on top of the Applications folder in order to copy it there. This action will begin the installation, which should only take a few seconds to complete.\r\n\r\n![Image showing how to drag Firefox and drop it in Applications folder](/images/guides/firefox_mac_03.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Eject the Firefox installation file\r\n\r\nAfter dragging the Firefox app to the Applications folder, go back to the desktop screen, move the mouse cursor over the Firefox icon, and click it while holding down the `control` key on your keyboard. Then select the `Eject Firefox` option.\r\n\r\n![Image showing how to eject the Firefox installation file](/images/guides/firefox_mac_04.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Open Firefox \r\n\r\nYou can now start Firefox by double-clicking on it in the Applications folder. The first time you open Firefox, you should receive a dialogue box that asks you if you are sure you would like to open Firefox. Here you should click `Open`. \r\n\r\n![Image showing the dialogue box that opens only on the first time starting Firefox](/images/guides/firefox_mac_05.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Finished!\r\n\r\nFirefox will now open. Congratulations, you have completed installing Firefox!\r\n\r\n![Image showing a fresh install of Firefox](/images/guides/firefox_mac_06.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Go to the Firefox download webpage\r\n\r\nVisit the [Firefox download page](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/windows/?utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=support.mozilla.org) in your pre-installed browser, such Internet Explorer or Edge.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the Firefox download page for Windows](/images/guides/firefox01.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Download Firefox Installer\r\n\r\nClick the `Download Now` button. This will prompt a notification bar at the top or bottom of your screen with an option to open, run, or save the Firefox Installer file. \r\n\r\n![Image showing the Firefox Installer download page for Windows](/images/guides/firefox02.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Run Firefox Installer\r\n\r\nClick on the `Run` or `Open` option in the notification bar to start the process. \r\n\r\n![Image showing the Open file option for the Firefox Installer in the notification bar](/images/guides/firefox03.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 4: _User Account Control_ Settings\r\n\r\nA _User Account Control_ dialogue may open that asks you to allow the Firefox Installer to make changes to your device. Click `Yes` to start the installation.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the User Account Control dialogue](/images/guides/firefox04.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Firefox Installation\r\n\r\nWait for Firefox to finish installing.\r\n\r\n![Image showing the Firefox installer running](/images/guides/firefox05.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Completing Firefox Installation\r\n\r\nWhen the installation is complete, Firefox will open. \r\n\r\nCongratulations, you have successfully installed Firefox! \r\n\r\n![Image showing a fresh install of Firefox](/images/guides/firefox06.PNG)\r\n","title":"Installing Firefox","description":"Firefox!","cover_image":"/images/img4.jpg"},{"slug":"gitguide","itemPath":"guides/gitguide","content":"\r\n# Git (and Git Bash)\r\n\r\n## What it is\r\n\r\nGit is a version control software used to manage and track changes made to files and project folders over time. We will be installing it on our local machine and live on the hard drive on your laptop. \r\n\r\nNote that Git is a separate software than GitHub. Alternatively, GitHub is a web-based software that lives on the Internet. You can create an account at [github.com](https://github.com).\r\n\r\nThese instructions are for Git, not GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Why we use it\r\n\r\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use Git because it is an open-source tool that was built to support individual version control needs as well as collaborations across time and space. In our curriculum, it is one of the foundational tools we teach because through understanding how Git works, we learn a lot more about how computers and different softwares work.\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Open a terminal\r\n\r\nThe terminal, also known as command line or bash, is a text interface for interacting with - or talking to - your computer. \r\n\r\nThis is different from how we usually interact with our computers. Usually, we use softwares that come with a graphical user interface - GUI, pronounced *gooey* - and we point and click on buttons, or drag and drop things. We might also type, like in Microsoft Word. However, in Word, you're not really talking to your computer until you click \"Save\" and name the file. It's at this point that you're telling your computer to perform a task in relation to the document or file you are creating or working on. \r\n\r\nWith Git, we talk to the computer through the terminal, so let's go ahead and open that now.\r\n\r\nTo open the terminal, open spotlight search (default way to do this is by hitting command and the space bar) and type in “terminal”. Select the application called terminal and press the return key. This should open up an app with a black background. When you see your username followed by a dollar sign, you’re ready to start using command line.\r\n\r\n![Image shows terminal, a black box in which you can enter text to interact with your computer.

It is used for Python programs that work with text in statistical natural language processing (NLP). In plain terms, NLTK allows users to work with collections of text to clean, categorize, and analyze that text. As such, it is an excellent tool for text analysis.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: NLTK comes installed with the [conda](conda.md) package management system and may already be installed in your environment.\r\n\r\n## Why we use it\r\n\r\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we use NLTK because it is a rich library of natural language processing tools and datasets. It works very well with Python, allowing users to write powerful natural language processing programs with relatively short sections of code. \r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: macOS Catalina\r\n\r\nBefore getting started, there are some things to note about software versions. First, these installation instructions work with recent versions of Mac OS X, like Catalina, Mojave, High Sierra, and they *should* work with older versions as well. \r\n\r\nSecond, if you have completed the Python workshop, you have probably downloaded the Anaconda package. Therefore, you may already have NLTK installed on your computer. The below instructions begin with an NLTK check and, in the case that you do not have NLTK installed, walk you through the installation.\r\n\r\nFinally, NLTK requires Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. The most recent Anaconda installation (which you downloaded for the Python workshop) comes with Python 3.8, so you should already have the relevant version of Python.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Checking if NLTK is already installed\r\n\r\nOpen an OSX terminal and type `python` to launch a Python interpreter. You should get something like this:\r\n\r\n![image of starting python interpreter](/images/guides/nltk_mac_1.png)\r\n\r\nLoad NLTK by typing the following in your environment and *pressing* 'enter':\r\n\r\n![image of importing nltk](/images/guides/nltk_mac_2.png)\r\n\r\nIf this step fails, you will get an error, and you should  follow the next step, Install NLTK. If it is already installed, nothing will happen and you'll see the three `\u003e\u003e\u003e` in the window. In that case, skip to Step 3, [Install NLTK Data](#step-3:-install-nltk-data-with-the-gui-(mac)).\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Install NLTK (MAC)\r\n\r\nExit the Python interpreter (`control-d` or `quit()`. Once you're back in your terminal, type:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ conda install nltk -y\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you press enter, the terminal should look something like the following:\r\n\r\n![image of installing nltk](/images/guides/nltk_mac_3.png)\r\n\r\nWhen it's finished, go back into the Python interpreter to import NLTK, typing `import NLTK` after the `\u003e\u003e\u003e`. If it downloaded correctly, nothing will happen and you'll see the three `\u003e\u003e\u003e` in the window.  In that case, continue to step 3.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Install NLTK Data with the GUI (MAC)\r\n\r\nYou then need to install the data that NLTK relies on to function. This may take several minutes (depending on your internet connection). Some packages may fail installation due to being outdated - this is alright, and will not be a problem for our lessons. If you get an error about a package failing, just shut down the install and skip to [installing NLTK with the command line](#step-4:-install-nltk-data-with-the-command-line-(mac)).\r\n\r\nIn your Python environment run the following command *after* import nltk:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e nltk.download()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, the interpreter above would now look like:\r\n\r\n![image of downloading nltk on interpreter](/images/guides/nltk_mac_4.png)\r\n\r\nThe Python environment that the GUI was launched from should now have a message that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nshowing info https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/index.xml\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNow, look for the NLTK download GUI - this will appear automatically but may appear hidden behind your browser window or behind where you are working in Python.\r\n\r\n![NLTK downloader interface with four tabs: collections, corpora, models, all packages](/images/guides/nltk_downloader.png)\r\n\r\nClick on the first tab (collections), and on the first record on that tab: all. Then, click the \"download\" button on the left hand side of that window.\r\n\r\nThis may take several minutes (depending on your internet connection). *Press* the refresh button if the install is stalling and ignore errors.\r\n\r\nIf something goes wrong, proceed to [installing NLTK with the command line](#step-4:-install-nltk-data-with-the-command-line). If nothing happens, then skip to the [install test](#step-5:-test-installation-(mac)).\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Install NLTK Data with the Command Line (MAC)\r\n\r\nNLTK also provides a text based download tool, which you can download with the Command Line.\r\n\r\nIn your interactive Python environment, type the following commands after importing nltk\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nnltk.download('all', halt_on_error=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interpreter above should now look something like:\r\n\r\n![image of entering nltk data download command on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_5.png)\r\n\r\nIf the command is successful, the terminal will print out something like:\r\n\r\n![image of downloading nltk data on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_6.png)\r\n\r\nIt will take a few minutes to download. At the end, your terminal should look like this, bringing you back to the python interpreter prompt:\r\n\r\n![image of completing the nltk data download on command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_7.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Test Installation (MAC)\r\n\r\nWhen the installation is complete, close the NLTK Downloader and check your installation. You need to be in a Python environment such as an interpreter or Jupyter notebook.\r\n\r\n**Brown**\r\n\r\nIn your Python environment, run the following code:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf your code runs and nothing happens (no error message and nothing printed to the screen), congratulations! \r\n\r\n***Book**\r\n\r\nCheck that the books corpus installed properly by typing:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nfrom nltk.book import *\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf installed successfully, you should see the following:\r\n\r\n![images of nltk books imported into command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_8.png)\r\n\r\n**Penn Parts of speech**\r\n\r\nCheck that the parts of speech tagger is installed correctly by typing the following:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\nnltk.help.upenn_tagset('NN')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf installed successfully, you should see the following:\r\n\r\n![image of nltk Part of Speech tagger installed into command line](/images/guides/nltk_mac_9.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: Microsoft Windows 10\r\n\r\nBefore getting started, there are some things to note about software versions.

It provides a Python programming environment, the Jupyter notebook environment, and the conda package management system. \r\n\r\n## Why we use it\r\n\r\nFor the Digital Humanities Research Institute, we are choosing to use and download Anaconda as it allow us to get all the required software for this institute (python, conda, and the Jupyter notebook environment) in a single download. Anaconda also includes many useful packages for machine learning, and data analysis that will be helpful should you choose to go further in your Python journey!. \r\n\r\n## Before we begin...\r\n\r\nLet's check if you have Anaconda already installed on your computer.\r\n\r\nTry to open the Anaconda Prompt (On Mac, click on the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as Spotlight) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar and type `Anaconda`. On Windows, press the \u003ckbd\u003eWindows\u003c/kbd\u003e key and type `Anaconda`). If no option comes up, you most likely don't have it installed.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can follow either the macOS Catalina or Windows instructions. If you do have Anaconda and only need to update Anaconda to the newest version for this workshop, you can go to our Insight section for [Keeping your Anaconda installation up to date](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/insights/blob/v2.0/pages/anaconda.md).\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions: macOS (Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur etc.)\r\n\r\nWhile the installation instructions below is for macOS Catalina (10.15) and above, this installation instruction should work for older macOS versions. Older macOS versions (10.13 (High Sierra) to 10.14 (Mojave)) can also skip step 3 in the installation process. For older versions, please check out the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#old-os). You can check your macOS version by clicking the \"apple\" icon on the upper-left corner of your menu bar and choose \"About This Mac.\" You should see the macOS name followed by the version number. Should you run into any trouble, you can also find solution to common installation issues [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/).\r\n\r\nAnother note, for MacOS Catalina and Big Sur, the Terminal window will likely show the `%` (percent sign) prompt, which is default for the newest version of Terminal. If you have an older version, it will show the `$` (dollar sign) prompt. Either prompt works the exact same, so it does not matter if yours is different from the instructions. Just be aware that they are interchangeable in these instructions.\r\n \r\n### Step 1: Download Python 3.+\r\n\r\nVisit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your internet browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, and scroll to the bottom of the page. Here, click on the **64-Bit Graphical Installer** under the MacOS Python 3.+ version menu. Our screenshot below shows python 3.8, but any latest **python 3.+** version will work with our instructions and the institute.  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: Anaconda download webpage with 3.8 button highlighted](/images/guides/conda_installer_mac.png)\r\n\r\nYou can ignore this. Just close this screen.  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: Anaconda thank you image](/images/guides/anaconda01.png)\r\n\r\nYou can either let your browser open with the Installer, or save it and open it yourself.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Run Anaconda Installer\r\n\r\nAfter the download has completed, if it doesn't open automatically, double-click on the installer file you just saved on your computer. Click `Continue`:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: Anaconda installer: security image](/images/guides/anaconda02-5.png)\r\n\r\nYou should then see the initial install screen. Click `Continue`:  \r\n \r\n ![Screenshot: initial installation image](/images/guides/anaconda03.png)\r\n\r\nClick `Continue` again:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: software licence agreement image](/images/guides/anaconda04.png)\r\n\r\nAccept the license by clicking `I Agree`:  \r\n \r\n![Screenshot: licence agreement](/images/guides/anaconda05.png)\r\n\r\nClick `Install`. Only change the install location if you know what you are doing:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: standard install on macintosh](/images/guides/anaconda06.png)\r\n\r\nClick `Install Microsoft VSCode`. If it is already installed, click `Continue`:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: menu option to also install vscode](/images/guides/anaconda08.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the final installation window. Just click `Close`:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: final installation window for anaconda](/images/guides/anaconda09.png)\r\n\r\nYou can move the installer to the Trash to save space on your hard drive by clicking `Move to Trash`:  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot: move to trash image](/images/guides/anaconda10.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Run conda from your terminal\r\n\r\n**NOTE: this step only applies to MacOS Catalina and Big Sur. For all previous version of MacOS, skip to Step 4**\r\n\r\nThis step ensures that you will be able to run anaconda directly from your terminal.  \r\n\r\nOpen your macOS terminal. You can find your terminal by clicking the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as `Spotlight`) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press \u003ckbd\u003ecommand\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003espace\u003c/kbd\u003e, type `Terminal` and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. In your terminal, you will run a few lines of code to make sure that the terminal knows how to start Anaconda. Type in the following lines of code, after the `%`, pressing \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e after each line:  \r\n\r\n```console\r\ncd ~\r\nbash\r\nsource .bash_profile\r\nconda init zsh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this step is successful, when you close and re-open terminal, your command prompt `%` should have (base) in front of it.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Check if Anaconda and Python are successfully installed\r\n\r\nOpen the macOS terminal. You can find your terminal by clicking the \"magnifying glass\" icon (also known as Spotlight) on the upper-right hand corner of your menubar or press \u003ckbd\u003ecommand\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003espace\u003c/kbd\u003e, type `Terminal` and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. In your terminal, type `python` and press \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. The terminal should print something like:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n~$ python\r\nPython 3.7.7 (default, May  6 2020, 04:59:01) \r\n[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e \r\n```\r\n\r\nType `exit()` to leave Python.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Ensure Anaconda Is Up-to-Date\r\n\r\nNow that Anaconda is installed, you need to ensure that Anaconda is updated to the newest version for this workshop.

Whether you want to test short code snippets or document your computational output and complement it with text and multimedia resources in a single document, Jupyter Notebooks is a great tool to use. Here are our short introduction to how to use Notebooks.\r\n\r\n## What are Notebooks?\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebooks is a form of \"computational notebook\" (sometimes called \"Notebook Interfaces\"). They have existed for decades, and were created to let users to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. They became popular among researchers for allowing them to annotate procedure, data and findings, making it easier for them to later reproduce calculations with different data.\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity in the past years, becoming by far the most used computational notebook.\r\n\r\n## How to open a Jupyter notebook\r\n\r\nIf you have not already installed Anaconda, please do so. Jupyter Notebook comes with Anaconda by default.\r\n\r\nFind and open the Anaconda Navigator on your computer (you should be able to find it in the folder with your other applications). From Anaconda Navigator's interface, launch a Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\n![jupyter](/images/guides/jupyter.png)\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebook will open as a tab in your default browser, which is where you will be working. All of the directories (folders) in your `home` directory will appear. (This may vary depending on what operating system—macOS, Windows, etc.—you are using, as the file structure can be different)\r\n\r\nWe will now open a new file. It is very important that you make sure to open the file in the right place, so you can find it later. Navigate on the directories clicking on them until you are on the desired directory.\r\n\r\nOnce you are in the right place, select `New` \u003e\u003e `Python3` in the upper right corner.\r\n\r\n![jupyter notebook \"open new file\" screen](/images/guides/jupyter1.png)\r\n\r\nA blank page with an empty box should appear.\r\n\r\n![empty box on jupyter notebook new file](/images/guides/jupyter2.png)\r\n\r\n## Running a cell\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebook allows you to write and run codes in containers, which we call cells. We won't go deep into how it works since it can get a bit complicated. For the moment, it is enough to know that we can run and see the output of the lines of code that are inside a cell.\r\n\r\nTo try, type some python code. You can try the classic `print(\"hello world!\")` or anything else you want. To run the cell, press \u003ckbd\u003eshift\u003c/kbd\u003e + \u003ckbd\u003eenter\u003c/kbd\u003e. That will give you an output, and create a new cell below.\r\n\r\n## Choosing, Starting, and Restarting a kernel\r\n\r\nYour notebook has a kernel, which is like an engine that executes the code contained in the cells. Again, we won't go too deep on this right now.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is to understand that while you are running codes in a notebook, the kernel will remember all the variables you've created, libraries you've imported, etc. And that will be true even if deleted a cell after you ran it.\r\n\r\nThis is very powerful, but can be a source of confusion. If you feel you have changed things too much, or that you are getting outputs you should not be getting, or if you experience some kind of crash, you can always restart the kernel, which will \"clean\" the memory of the kernel, and ask the notebook to run all the cells again. In that way, you will guarantee that the kernel will only have ran what is currently coded on the cells. To do that, on the top menu, click on `kernel` -\u003e `Restart \u0026 Run All`.
